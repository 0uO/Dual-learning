Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud . 
however , the Brenn@@ an Centre considers this a myth , stating that electoral fraud is rar@@ er in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning . 
indeed , Republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade . 
one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turn@@ -out .
