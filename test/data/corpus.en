resum@@ ption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament ad@@ jour@@ ned on Friday 17 December 1999 , and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant fes@@ tive period .
although , as you will have seen , the d@@ read@@ ed ` millenn@@ ium bug &apos; failed to materi@@ alise , still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were d@@ read@@ ful .
you have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days , during this part-session .
in the meantime , I should like to observe a minute &apos; s silence , as a number of Members have requested , on behalf of all the victims concerned , particularly those of the terrible stor@@ ms , in the various countries of the European Union .
please rise , then , for this minute &apos; s silence .
-LRB- The House rose and observed a minute &apos; s silence -RRB-
Madam President , on a point of order .
you will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bom@@ b explo@@ sions and k@@ ill@@ ings in Sri Lanka .
one of the people ass@@ assin@@ ated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr K@@ um@@ ar Pon@@ nam@@ bal@@ am , who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago .
would it be appropriate for you , Madam President , to write a letter to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an President expressing Parliament &apos;s regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and ur@@ ging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation ?
yes , Mr Evans , I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate .
if the House agrees , I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I would like your advice about Rule 14@@ 3 concerning in@@ ad@@ mis@@ sibility .
my question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again .
the C@@ un@@ ha report on multi@@ annual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually .
it says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability .
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to sub@@ ver@@ t it would be legally in@@ ad@@ missible .
I want to know whether one can raise an ob@@ jection of that kind to what is merely a report , not a legislative proposal , and whether that is something I can compet@@ ently do on Thursday .
that is precisely the time when you may , if you wish , raise this question , i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report .
Madam President , coinci@@ ding with this year &apos; s first part-session of the European Parliament , a date has been set , unfortunately for next Thursday , in Texas in America , for the execution of a young 34 year-old man who has been sent@@ enced to death . we shall call him Mr H@@ ic@@ ks .
at the request of a French Member , Mr Zim@@ er@@ ay , a petition has already been presented , which many people signed , including myself .
however , I would ask you , in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community , to make represent@@ ations , using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent , to the President and to the Govern@@ or of Texas , Mr Bush , who has the power to order a stay of execution and to re@@ pri@@ eve the condemned person .
this is all in accordance with the principles that we have always uph@@ eld .
thank you , Mr Seg@@ ni , I shall do so gladly .
indeed , it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted .
Madam President , I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest .
it is the case of Alexander Nik@@ iti@@ n .
all of us here are pleased that the courts have acqu@@ itted him and made it clear that in Russia , too , access to environmental information is a constitutional right .
now , however , he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosec@@ utor is appe@@ aling .
we know , and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed , including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year , that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nik@@ iti@@ n to be accused of criminal activity and treas@@ on because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings .
these findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Bar@@ ents Sea , and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament &apos;s position , as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted , clear as far as Russia is concerned .
yes , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , I shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when I have received your letter .
Madam President , I would firstly like to compli@@ ment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that , during this first part-session of the new year , the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably .
but , Madam President , my personal request has not been met .
although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one , there is still no Dutch channel , which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of ex@@ ile every month .
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well .
Mrs P@@ loo@@ ij@@ -@@ van Gor@@ sel , I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Qu@@ a@@ est@@ ors &apos; meeting on Wednesday .
it will , I hope , be examined in a positive light .
Madam President , can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes ?
why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected ?
why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998 ?
why has there been no fire dri@@ ll , either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings ?
why are there no fire instructions ?
why have the sta@@ ir@@ cases not been improved since my accident ?
why are no-@@ smoking areas not enforced ?
it seems absolutely dis@@ gra@@ c@@ eful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves .
Mrs Lyn@@ ne , you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done .
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Qu@@ a@@ est@@ ors , and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on .
Madam President , Mrs D@@ í@@ ez Gonz@@ á@@ lez and I had tabled questions on certain opinions of the Vice-President , Mrs de Palacio , which appeared in a Spanish newspaper .
the competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session .
I would ask that they re@@ consider , since this is not the case .
the questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio &apos; s intervention , on another occasion , and not to these comments which appeared in the AB@@ C newspaper on 18 November .
Mr Ber@@ en@@ gu@@ er Fu@@ ster , we shall check all this .
I admit that , at present , the matter seems to be somewhat confused .
we shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be .
Madam President , I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our dis@@ content over today &apos;s decision ref@@ using to rene@@ w the arms embargo on Indonesia , considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past ?
today &apos;s decision not to rene@@ w the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there .
so Parliament should send a message , since that is the wish of the vast majority .
it is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to rene@@ w the embargo .
as people have said , the situation there is extremely vol@@ atile .
there is , in fact , a risk of a military cou@@ p in the future .
we do not know what is happening .
so why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people ?
in any event , this question is not pres@@ ently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on Thursday .
agenda
the next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure .
no amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday .
relating to Wednesday :
the Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission .
I would like Mr Barón Crespo , who made the request , to speak to propose it . that is , if he so wishes , of course .
then we shall follow the usual procedure , hearing one speaker in favour and one against .
Madam President , the presentation of the Prodi Commission &apos; s political programme for the whole legislat@@ ure was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi , who reiter@@ ated his commitment in his inaug@@ ural speech .
this commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and , therefore , basically dict@@ ates this Parliament &apos; s political and legislative activity for the next five years .
I would also like to point out , Madam President , that this Parliament voted to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislat@@ ure . it did so again during this legislat@@ ure , in July , and then , in September , it voted once more to approve the whole Commission .
there has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens .
to this end , I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September , which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible .
the events of last week - which origin@@ ated outside the Conference of Presidents , that Conference being used simply to cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a di@@ lem@@ ma . either the Commission is not ready to present this programme , in which case it should clarify it .
according to its President , it is in a position to do so .
given that the Commission is represented by Vice-President de Palacio , I believe that , before voting , it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme , as agreed . alternatively , Parliament is not ready to examine this programme , as some appear to be sugges@@ ting .
my Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen , debate and reflect , there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that , if the Commission is ready to do so , we still have time to re-@@ establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfil@@ s our duty to our fellow citizens .
therefore , Madam President , I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote .
-LRB- Applause from the PSE Group -RRB-
Madam President , I really am quite aston@@ ished at Mr Barón Crespo &apos; s behaviour and the fact that he is now asking for this item to be put on Wednesday &apos;s agenda .
Mr Barón Crespo , you were unable to attend the Conference of Presidents last Thursday .
I am not critic@@ ising this ; it happens from time to time that people send someone to represent them .
Mr Hän@@ sch represented you on this occasion .
in the Conference of Presidents , we had an in-depth discussion .
your Group was alone in advoc@@ ating what you are saying now .
we then put it to a vote .
as you know , each chairman has the same number of votes as his Group has Members .
there was a vote on this matter .
as I recall , the outcome of this vote was 4@@ 22 votes to 180 with a few ab@@ sten@@ tions .
this means that all the Grou@@ ps with the exception of the non-@@ attached Members - but , of course , they are not a Group - were in agreement ; only your Group thought that we should proceed as you have proposed here .
all of the others were of a different opinion .
that was the decision .
I should now like to comment on the issue itself .
we have confidence in the Commission and in Rom@@ ano Prodi and , after a difficult procedure , as everyone knows , the vast majority of our Group supported the vote of confidence in Rom@@ ano Prodi and the Commission .
we believe , however , that the Commission &apos;s strategic plan needs to be debated within a proper procedural framework , not only on the basis of an oral statement here in the European Parliament , but also on the basis of a document which is adopted in the Commission and which describes this programme over the five-@@ year period .
there is no such document !
the Commission will present its programme for the year 2000 in February .
we have said , very well , if the Commission does not wish to introduce the 2000 programme as early as January then we will do it in February .
we have agreed to this .
after all , we do not wish to quar@@ rel with the Commission ; if at all possible , we believe that the Commission and Parliament need to tre@@ ad the same path .
however , we in Parliament also have a supervisory role with regard to the Commission and we do not have to agree with everything which comes out of the Commission .
I should like us to be able to do a reasonable amount of preparation for the debate on the five-@@ year programme in our Grou@@ ps .
you can not prepare if you hear a statement in this House and have no idea of its content .
the fact that the subjects are connected also suggests that we should hold the debate on both programmes together .
that is why my Group firmly re@@ jects the proposal made by the Socialist Group .
-LRB- Applause from the PPE-DE Group -RRB-
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be re@@ inst@@ ated .
-LRB- Parliament rejected the request -RRB- President .
still on the subject of Wednesday &apos; s sitting , I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax .
the PPE-DE Group is requ@@ esting that this item be taken off the agenda .
is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this ?
Madam President , I can hear a ri@@ pp@@ le of lau@@ ghter from the Socialists . I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda , because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter .
I do not know whether this information is correct , but the PPE-DE Group would , in any case , be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already .
decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind .
that is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda .
thank you , Mr Poettering .
we shall now hear Mr Wur@@ tz speaking against this request .
Madam President , I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering &apos; s lack of logic .
he has just been pre@@ aching to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of Presidents , and now he is doing just the same .
we discussed that matter and we were unanimous , with the exception of the PPE and EL@@ DR Grou@@ ps .
as my fellow chair@@ men will recall , I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tob@@ in tax , but of whether one dar@@ ed to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it .
it is not a lot to ask .
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out , once and for all , the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion , particularly after the ti@@ de of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference .
we shall proceed to vote on the PPE-DE Group &apos; s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda .
-LRB- Parliament rejected the request , with 16@@ 4 votes for , 16@@ 6 votes against and 7 ab@@ sten@@ tions -RRB-
Madam President , I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate .
thank you very much .
Madam President , has my vote been counted ?
I was unable to vote electron@@ ically , since I do not have a card .
my vote was `` in favour &apos;&apos; .
Madam President , the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote .
there is no room for amendments .
Madam President , in the earlier vote - and I will ab@@ ide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group .
that did not happen .
I would appreciate it if , on the close of this item of business , I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group .
this is an important matter .
it would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perc@@ ei@@ ve what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis .
Madam President , I do not wish to re@@ open the debate , but I had also asked for the floor , to comment on Mr Barón Crespo &apos;s motion .
you did not call me either .
I regret this , but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there .
I am terri@@ bly sorry , Mr Hän@@ sch and Mr Cox .
I did not see you asking to speak .
even so , I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes .
when we adopt the Minutes for today &apos; s sitting tomorrow , then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments .
this seems to me to be a work@@ able solution .
of course , the Minutes for tomorrow &apos; s sitting will take into account any additional explanations .
I think this is a better solution than proceed@@ ing now to extremely time-@@ consum@@ ing explanations of votes .
Mr Cox , Mr Hän@@ sch , would this be acceptable to you ?
Madam President , if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not , and can not , object to that .
if your ruling is that I can not give an explanation of vote , I accept that but with reservations .
we shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes , as we always do , of course .
if they do not properly reflect the positions adopted , then we may correct them , if necessary .
-LRB- The order of business was adopted thus amended -RRB-
safety advis@@ ers for the transport of dangerous goods
Commissioner , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I can be quite fran@@ k in saying that I welcome the Council &apos;s common position on harmon@@ ising the training of safety advis@@ ers for the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail or inland water@@ way .
firstly , we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96 @/@ 35 @/@ EC , which ob@@ liges the Member States to ap@@ point safety advis@@ ers and to organise the training , instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly .
secondly , by adopting this directive we achieve a -RRB- an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and tran@@ shi@@ pped ; b -RRB- a reduction in distor@@ tions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c -RRB- equal opportunities for safety advis@@ ers on the European labour market .
thirdly , this directive , as it currently stands in the common position , guarantees - in particular because it con@@ fin@@ es itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union ; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States &apos; bearing a high level of individual responsibility .
all of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed .
our amendments from the first reading have , I believe , been taken into account very satisfac@@ tor@@ ily .
they have either been accepted or trans@@ posed with no change in the substance , or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included , for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions .
the one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport , which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive , is something which I would urge you to support .
by not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force , we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay .
I would urge you to endorse this .
as an Austrian , I still have a vi@@ vi@@ d memory , as , I believe , we all do , of the catastro@@ phe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tau@@ ern T@@ unnel , where subsequent work to re@@ build the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense .
the renov@@ ation project , which last@@ ed for months , cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe .
the traffic which had to be diver@@ ted because of this stret@@ ched the pati@@ ence of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit .
in fact , all hell broke loo@@ se in some municip@@ alities in my province .
prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-@@ trained safety advis@@ ers being available , so that the right action is taken in good time .
all the same , we must not content ourselves with en@@ acting European law to ensure greater safety .
we also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are trans@@ posed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards .
please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to l@@ ament the lack of enforcement .
I should like to address one final point . we must not content ourselves with se@@ aling another hole in the safety net and sh@@ utting our eyes to the fact that , where transport safety in Europe is concerned , there is still much more to be done .
in this context , I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible , who is with us here today , to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit t@@ unn@@ els in the future , so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale .
Madam President , first of all I should like to thank Mr K@@ och for his report which has , at its heart , the issue of transport safety .
the report looks at the issue of harmon@@ ising the examination requirements for safety advis@@ ors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road , rail and inland water@@ way .
I congratulate him on his excellent report .
the rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament &apos;s ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament &apos;s other amendments has been retained .
my Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the en@@ ac@@ tment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible .
when it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety .
we still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved .
Madam President , I would like to make a few comments .
I would like , first of all , to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and , secondly , the Commission for the proposal it has submitted .
we are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also , in fact , with minimum requirements .
this is a pity , in a sense .
need@@ less to say , safety on roads , railways and inland water@@ ways is of key importance and , given the international nature of these types of transport , training for safety advis@@ ors should also be harmonised , therefore , as well as the requirements of the new AD@@ R , for example , which is under way .
this is important , but so is enforcement and there are , of course , a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this .
just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years , for example in Belgium , the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lor@@ ries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in f@@ og@@ g@@ y conditions when really they should have pul@@ led off the road instead .
or ships from Eastern Europe which mo@@ or adjacent to ships over here , with all the obvious risks that this entails .
furthermore , it has transp@@ ired that research in the ports in Belgium , Finland , but also in Japan has shown that 50 % of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment .
in short , the issue is an important one .
if we look at the situation where safety advis@@ ers are concerned , in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advis@@ ers in companies as from 1 January of this year .
there will be major problems with en@@ forcing this rule at present , especially with smaller companies , as these can not afford safety advis@@ ors .
these smaller companies either dis@@ pose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo , which causes problems .
it is therefore also being requested that ISO 9@@ 00@@ 2 certificates possibly include the fin@@ er details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses .
the work is done . all that remains is the business of enforcement .
I would like to mention one final point .
with regard to enforcement , proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001 , that is to say in eigh@@ teen months &apos; time .
this gives them a competitive edge for the interim period .
this is not in itself anything d@@ read@@ ful , but we should priori@@ tise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road , rail and inland water@@ ways and incorporate these , as part of the acquis commun@@ au@@ taire , as soon as possible and present them to the acc@@ eding states .
Madam President , the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so .
the ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks , known and unknown , for employees and the social environment .
those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements .
the relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive , 95 @/@ 35 @/@ EC , seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods .
I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding exam@@ in@@ ations , although I would have preferred it if uniform , set standards and modules had been established , so that certificates would be of equal value internationally .
this , however , does not seem feasible .
finally , the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can , therefore , give it my wholehear@@ ted support .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should first like to congratulate Mr K@@ och on his reports which , though technical , are nonetheless of very great significance for safety .
I should like to make just a few comments .
firstly , I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fer@@ tile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety , be it on the roads , on the water@@ ways or at sea .
considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998 , even though Parliament responded relatively quickly , this time lag is a little too long .
this is not just the fault of the Commission , but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well .
my second point has already been mentioned : it concerns the minimum standards .
in principle , I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and countr@@ y-@@ specific rules .
however , when it comes to safety , I am rather scep@@ tical because safety in Sweden , for example , is in principle no different from safety in Germany , Italy or Austria .
I can live with these minimum standards , but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully .
should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation .
my third point has also been mentioned already .
as you know , like Mr R@@ ack , I come from a transit country , where this issue plays a particularly important role .
we do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilater@@ ally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries .
but I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum , in all countries , whether they are transit countries or not .
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr K@@ och , on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal ; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the ap@@ titude examination for safety advis@@ ers in the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail or inland water@@ way .
we understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy , and in particular the transport group , is magnificent .
the common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmon@@ ises the minimum examination requirements for safety advis@@ ers and , at second reading , we can accept the amendment on the proposed date , which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission , bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question .
very briefly , I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission &apos; s priorities in the field of transport .
as Mr Simp@@ son has said very correctly , this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end .
the process of increasing safety marg@@ ins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day .
in this regard , I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the t@@ unn@@ els , which Mess@@ rs R@@ ack and Swoboda have referred to , which , in the case of Austria , is doub@@ tless a very sensitive issue , and great effort should be made to improve their safety .
in one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently , the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves .
mar@@ gar@@ ine and a few kil@@ os of paint which , in principle , do not present risks , led to a genuine disaster .
therefore , we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved .
finally , I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport .
this week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport , in light of the Erika disaster , and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport .
but I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission .
as I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster , we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety , but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances , which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem .
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur , Mr K@@ och .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m .
transport of dangerous goods by road
delays in the C@@ EN &apos; s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive .
in particular , an@@ nex@@ es can not be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments .
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job .
in this respect , I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94 @/@ 55 @/@ EC which has been tabled for discussion today .
should the European Union fail to take action , then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period , until the C@@ EN complet@@ es its work , which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty .
the amendment to the directive on today &apos;s agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community .
it merely pro@@ lon@@ gs transitional rules by postp@@ oning deadlines , del@@ etes provisions which are no longer applicable , and lays down the procedures for a -RRB- carrying out the ad ho@@ c transportation of dangerous goods and b -RRB- en@@ acting less stringent national regulations , in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas .
the amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ; the Member States obtain more powers .
the Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own .
in so doing , it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure .
the procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers confer@@ red on the Commission were laid down af@@ res@@ h in the Council Dec@@ ision of June 1999 .
the proposal to be discussed today , to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road , dates from May 1999 , however , and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure .
two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure .
we would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the rec@@ it@@ als and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly wor@@ ded - is set at a maximum of three months .
in addition , the need for greater transparency has been pointed out .
a further amendment allows the Member States to impose more stringent requirements , in particular for vacuum tanks , if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below -@@ 20@@ º@@ C .
this is in the special interest of northern European regions .
a final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tank@@ ers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it .
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety , but I would ask you to endorse this report .
Mr President , colleagues , a happy new year and millenn@@ ium to you all .
I am speaking for the first time in this plenary part-session , so this is quite exciting for me , a little like first love , although that did last longer than two minutes .
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission &apos; s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road .
it is good that this directive should be established now , as , otherwise , Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time , a period of transition , which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy .
the Commission &apos; s proposal , however , does not take account of all the facts , such as the cold climate that prev@@ ails in the northern regions .
consequently , I have tabled some amendments to Mr K@@ och &apos; s in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally excellent report , which have been adopted by our committee .
my amendments concern the fro@@ st-@@ resistance rat@@ ings for tank@@ ers carrying these dangerous goods .
according to the Commission &apos; s proposal -@@ 20@@ º@@ C would have been sufficient .
on the shores of the Mediterranean , it is hard to imagine that in La@@ pl@@ and temperatures can fall considerably lower than that .
there is support for the EU in La@@ pl@@ and also , so let us remember them .
I have thus proposed that the fro@@ st rating be lower@@ ed to -@@ 40@@ º@@ C .
this would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously .
I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow &apos; s vote .
Mr President , with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admir@@ ation for the way in which you executed the quick chan@@ ge@@ over of the chair@@ man@@ ship just now during the debate .
I thought that it was quite superb .
on the subject at hand , I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe &apos;s roads , railways , and so on are as safe as possible .
this directive is a contribution to this .
what we are doing today is essentially a nu@@ is@@ ance .
the rapporteur , Mr K@@ och , to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this , has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the in@@ activity on the part of the C@@ EN , which has been very di@@ lat@@ ory in drawing up and adapting the directive .
that is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that , in 2001 , we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer .
Mr President , the report we are discussing here does not , in itself , ent@@ ail any major changes . most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature .
it is nonetheless worth emphas@@ ising that , each time we make this type of decision , it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for explo@@ iting the possibilities of the internal market .
very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the EU , both on roads and railways and by sea .
this makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind . in area after area , we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States .
this is extra@@ ordin@@ arily positive , and there is cause to thank the rapporteur , Mr K@@ och , for the work he has put in on this issue .
this is also important where the prerequis@@ ites for the internal market are concerned .
if we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running , it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also , as far as possible , apply to every country .
I should like to conclude by comm@@ enting on a third matter which is also of significance , namely an amendment tabled by Member of Parliament , Mr A@@ ri V@@ at@@ anen .
in many ways , the prerequis@@ ites differ from one Member State to another .
by appro@@ ving this amendment , we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the European Union .
this makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind .
it is good that , in establishing the present regulations , we can also be flexible . I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment .
Mr President , I would like to thank not only Mr K@@ och , but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and un@@ ambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority .
the reason Mr K@@ och produced his sound report was because the work in the C@@ EN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceed@@ ing none too expe@@ di@@ ti@@ ously .
I would like to ask the Vice-President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations , and whether the EU is in a position to ha@@ sten these harmonisation efforts , in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible .
for one thing is clear : even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union , traffic does not stop at our borders , it goes beyond them .
hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions .
if the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the C@@ EN and the Economic Commission are at ?
Mr President , I would once again like to congratulate Mr K@@ och on his magnificent work on this other report , which in a way suppl@@ ements the debate which we held in October on rail transport .
we all regret that the European Committee for Stand@@ ardis@@ ation -LRB- C@@ EN -RRB- has not been able , in the required time , to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union .
this debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differenti@@ ating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours .
a moment ago , Mr V@@ at@@ anen spoke to us of lower temperatures , not of 20 degrees below zero , but of 40 degrees below zero .
of course , we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the clim@@ atic diversity of the European Union , which sometimes take the form of specific@@ s and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and character@@ is@@ ations of a technical nature .
I would like to say , with regard to Mr Swoboda &apos; s comments on the activity of the C@@ EN , that we are ur@@ ging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if , despite the new deadline , we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded .
lastly , Mr President , the basic problems justi@@ fying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out . we have referred to the delay by the C@@ EN , the amendment of certain provisions , the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the an@@ nex@@ es and the need to for it to be more specific .
the Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur , Mr K@@ och , which are contained in the various amendments , specifically four .
we therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m .
structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination
the next item is the report -LRB- A5-0@@ 10@@ 8 @/@ 1999 -RRB- by Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund : guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-@@ 2006 -LSB- COM -LRB- 1999 -RRB- 3@@ 44 - C5-0@@ 12@@ 2 @/@ 1999 - 1999 @/@ 2@@ 12@@ 7 -LRB- CO@@ S -RRB- -RSB- .
Mr President , it is particularly pleas@@ ing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament , namely Wales .
a major part of Wales , as you know , has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme .
it is quite clear that many people within Wales are looking to the European Structural Funds programme to allevi@@ ate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face .
we have seen poverty growing in Wales ; and growing still further since 1997 .
we have seen the gap between rich and poor wi@@ den .
we are looking , therefore , within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Prin@@ cip@@ ality .
what is , however , deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been , in a sense , a success of the government .
it is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces .
that is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the for@@ efront .
we look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to addi@@ tionality .
we are dis@@ satisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures .
we look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects .
we look to it to challenge the UK Government , to ensure that the private sector , which surely must be providing the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure , is involved in the planning stage .
finally , we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund mon@@ ies are spent in a way which is transparent .
too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent .
this is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales .
Mr President , our committee views these issues very differently and , to start , I will speak from the point of view of research .
we see it as a very positive sign that , in her own conclusions , the rapporteur has taken account of our committee &apos; s proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should bro@@ aden the research infrastructure by loc@@ ating universities and coll@@ eg@@ es in such a way that they would serve those who live in un@@ developed regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts .
this will be possible with action on the part of governments , and such decentr@@ alisation of higher education will be an un@@ question@@ ably useful policy in evening out development .
another matter we would like to address , specifically from the point of view of industrial policy , is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services , electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet , when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds .
poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood .
the rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry , but today those areas might have become a burden , and they may well be poor , meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production , as I might call it , and the production of services , because they are the industries of the future .
in my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this , so on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , I would draw the Commission &apos; s attention to this issue .
finally , as the committee representing energy , we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more , thus , through a process of coordination , increasing the use of renew@@ ables so that the sc@@ ant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compens@@ ated by means of these more substantial sums .
Mr President , I would very much like to thank Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that I am speaking for my colleague , Mrs F@@ lau@@ tre , who followed this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who is unfortunately ill .
I would like to draw people &apos;s attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
these amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion .
in the past , this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment .
these amendments also fit in with this Parliament &apos;s view that social exclusion is a serious issue need@@ ing constructive action .
we hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment .
in her report , Mrs F@@ lau@@ tre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sor@@ ely lacking , yet desper@@ ately needed .
the Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund .
but the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regret@@ ted , as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-@@ 2006 programme .
it could be said that the om@@ is@@ sion gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance , which is subject to review after three and a half years , and the Member States &apos; annual national plans for employment .
we hope that the Commission can re@@ assure us that this was an over@@ sight which is now being dealt with construc@@ tively .
Mr President , Commissioner , the proposal presented by the Commission , in accordance with its mandate , is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
I would like to point out , however , that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us : maintaining a population in rural areas , given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture &apos; s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society .
this , as well as the defic@@ ien@@ cies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment , which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity , exacerb@@ ates the exo@@ dus from rural areas .
the consequences do not insp@@ ire hope .
it is the young people who are dis@@ appearing , who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas , all of which has an un@@ favourable effect on those areas .
this lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs .
we have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fif@@ ths of the territory of the European Union .
agriculture only provides 5.@@ 5 % of employment in the Union .
furthermore , three quarters of our farm workers are part-@@ time and require suppl@@ ements to their incomes .
therefore , we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set . we want rural areas , at the da@@ wn of the 21st century , to be competitive and multi-@@ functional , both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non-@@ agricultural activities .
it is important to priori@@ tise general criteria for land planning and demographic equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um , and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues , which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport , Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17 .
in conclusion , I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that , for the European Union , maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , the rapporteur , for her work .
I think that this work has been carried out extremely well .
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formul@@ as have needed to be reached in the face of this av@@ al@@ an@@ che of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing .
we feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament , at least in spirit , because at this stage , it might seem as though what we are doing here is a us@@ eless exercise , and nothing but hot air .
the truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the Commission must take account of what is adopted by this Parliament , particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives .
in our amendments , we have stated the importance of the necessary syn@@ ergies being produced between the Structural Funds , the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives , so that their application should be reflected , in the best and most profitable way , by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are , when all is said and done , the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing .
in order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for at@@ taining these objectives , we think that those who generate employment , the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment , that is , busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople , must participate in this initiative .
small and medium-sized businesses , above all , need to take part in the distribution of these funds .
if they do not , if busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople feel margin@@ alised , if entrepreneurs can not take part , not only in managing but also in receiving these funds , we will have missed an opportunity to at@@ tain our objectives more rapidly .
also , in order to at@@ tain our objectives , to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment , it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies , to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies .
all of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business , which , by un@@ iting its efforts with those of public administr@@ ations , but compl@@ ement@@ ing them , never obstruc@@ ting or excluding them , will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs .
Mr President , it is inc@@ umb@@ ent upon me to remind my colleague , Mr Evans , of why Wales actually achieved Objective 1 status .
it was because of the dis@@ credited policies of his own Conserv@@ ative Party .
let me also remind him that when his party leader , Mr Hague , was Secretary of State for Wales , he broke every rule in the book on addi@@ tionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner W@@ ul@@ f-@@ Ma@@ th@@ ies regarding regulatory requirements .
I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 addi@@ tionality .
I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation .
my Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today .
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines .
the objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic re@@ generation , to get the most effective use of resources in the wi@@ dest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-@@ support machine .
it is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi@@ -@@ tech sector .
it is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in the hi@@ -@@ tech growth industries of the future .
the operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instruc@@ tive in telling us what guidelines should not be about .
they should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape .
they should not be about shi@@ fting priorities and policies hal@@ f@@ way through project development , resulting in inevitable delays and under@@ sp@@ ends , particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement .
the implementation and operation of the guidelines can not be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer , either in the Commission or in the civil service .
there must be an internal coherence in the Commission direc@@ torate , while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes .
the conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad , indic@@ ative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund@@ -@@ users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of re@@ generation .
if we can in@@ ject a spirit of entrepreneur@@ ial activity into our poor and struc@@ tur@@ ally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attrac@@ ting substantial invest@@ or confidence , which will be the key to future success .
this is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines : whether EU regional policy with a good , solid , enabling gui@@ del@@ ine , can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and struc@@ tur@@ ally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter for an excellent report .
she has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report .
the rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines .
we are badly behind now in this matter .
hopefully , the stands Parliament has taken will help , however , in the mid-@@ term app@@ ra@@ is@@ al of the programmes and in their practical implementation .
for the time , the report grew too large when it was being debated . it contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports .
at this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to ste@@ er Union regional policy , bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality .
our Group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity , the responsibility of Member States and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes . it is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes .
our Group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas .
we oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes .
projects implemented with support from the Union have had their effect water@@ ed down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes .
funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned . projects have to be carried out more efficiently , more flexi@@ bly and they have to be made more productive .
while the report was being prepared , it was interesting to discuss the Union &apos; s regional policy in general .
for us new members , it was the first time , and this was a very interesting process .
this report is very good and our Group supports it .
Mr President , Commissioner , as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consult@@ ative and sub@@ ordin@@ ate institution , the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group , Elis@@ abeth Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-@@ 2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission &apos; s offices for several months .
Mr President , we should not forget that the main , strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion .
we are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results .
we are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Reg@@ ions .
we feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion .
we might be mis@@ taken in using the gross domestic product per inhabit@@ ant as the sole indic@@ ator .
some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population .
we will have to study several indicators , which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others , and how they are evol@@ ving .
it is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to Parliament &apos; s plenary sitting today that Europe &apos; s 25 most prosper@@ ous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosper@@ ous regions .
this fact means that the European Parliament , the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisi@@ vely and strateg@@ ically .
I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity , as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives .
I do not think , however , that this report has come too late .
we need to consider it together , so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development , which have been drafted before the directives come into force , can be submitted for revision and proper assessment .
we all agree that we should ask that , hal@@ f@@ way through these programmes , when the assessment of the directives is made , Parliament should be given an equally influ@@ ential role on the grounds that we are the citizens &apos; representatives .
our citizens can not accept that the European Union takes decisions in a way that is , at least on the face of it , bureaucratic .
they need to see the political dimension working , to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens .
this is what we are today asking the Commissioner for .
I would like to think that , given his previous experience as a regional President , he will agree to propose indicators , and a strategy , which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity .
Mr President , I support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000-@@ 2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following : there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds .
this means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent .
Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for re@@ vit@@ alising relations between towns and rural areas . this latter point is of particular importance .
while urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city d@@ well@@ ers .
we do not want to build a Europe of cities alone .
the Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries , mainly through the upgra@@ ding of roads , water treatment and related transport networks .
this process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year , which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session .
key EU programmes between 1989 , 1993 , 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe .
the key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date .
this would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ul@@ tra@@ peripheral regions , the poorer regions in Europe , are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone , as well as within an ever-@@ expanding internal market where the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital exist .
in conclusion , while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund , we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-@@ off in our society .
the Social Fund has certainly improved our third-@@ level institutions , financed our post-@@ leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long-term unemployment , assist early school lea@@ vers and promote higher standards of adult liter@@ acy .
Mr President , on numerous occasions in the past I have dis@@ agreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues . this time , however , I actually agree with her .
whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path , I can not say . nevertheless , I would like to commend her on her work .
the second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an an@@ nex , as we and Mrs Mc@@ Car@@ thy , as rapporteurs for the general regulation , had asked .
unfortunately , this did not happen . Mr Ber@@ ni@@ é is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee .
I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament &apos; s position .
thirdly , we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not devi@@ ate from the comments we have made so far .
they are particularly beneficial to the Member States , and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development , job creation and , more particularly , on equal opportunities and transport issues .
personally , I at least am totally in favour of the guidelines .
as an is@@ lander , however , I would like to express my dis@@ satisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development .
this is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves . this has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament , and I have raised the issue time and time again .
Commissioner , we shall continue to raise the issue , as Article 15@@ 8 , paragraph 1 , of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands .
therefore , the Commission should address the issue once and for all .
the time has come to implement the programmes , and so Member States should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly .
as for us in Parliament , I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which was signed in May .
I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep ab@@ re@@ ast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes .
Mr President , Commissioner , in this minute and a half I should like , first of all , to congratulate Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter .
I know many have already done so , but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and atten@@ tive to proposals from all sides , and I think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today .
I share the reg@@ rets she expressed , namely that Parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines , since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that I can not see this report having any sort of immediate effect , which in my view is a pity .
consequently , I feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid-@@ term review in 2003 , and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003 .
in brief , I would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000-@@ 2006 , which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face .
the first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies .
subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking .
we must ask ourselves a fundamental question : how can we ensure that Union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development ?
the second challenge is that of enlargement which will , of course , have a considerable impact , both in budgetary and geographical terms .
these are two areas of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us .
finally , in this time of natural disasters , I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds .
as you know , it is up to each State to re@@ distribute part of the total appropri@@ ation .
Europe should not be completely ab@@ sent , as the states tend to want .
public opinion and the press nowadays acc@@ use us of being un@@ available to give a response , even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations .
I think we should be capable of saying this l@@ oud and clear .
I also think we should ensure , or ask Member States to ensure , that there is some public@@ ity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents .
Mr President , the priority given to financial and monetary criteria rein@@ forces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form .
as far as French planning experts are concerned , for example , the most prob@@ able scenario today is that of the entr@@ en@@ ch@@ ment of regional disparities within each country .
well , the Structural Funds have helped to apply a bra@@ ke to this process .
our project of a Europe that aims to satisfy social needs envis@@ ages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common den@@ omin@@ ator .
its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of re@@ distribution instruments such as the Structural Funds .
what we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax , which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level .
the Commission , however , though bound to issue guidelines , does so only reluct@@ antly and in a vague manner .
the report put forward today re-@@ establishes its place in the political sphere .
it is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development .
this is what persu@@ ades us to vote in favour of it .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .
over the coming years , faced with the challenges of globalisation and e@@ ast@@ ward enlargement , Europe will , more than ever before , require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and re@@ vit@@ alise its economy .
to this end , Europe as a whole , and each Member State individually , will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities , including the Structural Funds .
for this to be possible , what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions , but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States .
for example , in recent years Italy has had problems in utilis@@ ing the Structural Funds , mainly because of excessive bureaucracy , insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level .
I will conclude , Mr President , by saying that the failure of the Commission &apos; s communication to focus on territorial p@@ acts and , especially , methods of combating unemployment among women and young people , is cause for serious concern .
Mr President , like my colleague Mr Evans , it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue , especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom , the West Mid@@ lands , which has hi@@ ther@@ to benef@@ ited from Objective 2 funding in particular .
but the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how , if we are not very careful , we can produce very gr@@ andi@@ o@@ se-@@ sound@@ ing ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them .
the report itself is well-@@ inten@@ tioned but , as so often when we deal with these issues , lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for oper@@ ability .
that is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and addi@@ tions to the text , not to take anything away from the proposal , but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide .
I would like to explain our thinking here .
firstly , we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds .
past experience dict@@ ates that , as the elected representatives of the European taxpay@@ er , we should , and indeed must , demand financial prob@@ ity and transparency in the dis@@ bur@@ sement and audi@@ ting of this money , hence our amendments and addi@@ tions relate to achieving what are known as `` value for money &apos;&apos; indicators in the gr@@ ant-@@ giving process .
next , we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose out@@ comes will necessarily be un@@ clear at the start of the programme period .
but at the mid-@@ way point or end of that period there is no effective way of termin@@ ating the project if it has not proved successful .
our addi@@ tions therefore call for the provision of practical en@@ forc@@ eable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requ@@ is@@ ite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpay@@ er , but we also avoid the well-@@ re@@ hear@@ sed syn@@ dro@@ me of thro@@ wing good money after bad .
finally , we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are dis@@ bur@@ sed .
there should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equ@@ ation .
also the type of project funded needs to be shi@@ fted away from small-@@ scale re@@ ven@@ u@@ e-@@ based projects , which are hard to monitor , towards capital schemes where , in the majority of cases , the benefits are there for all to see .
that way the mu@@ ch-@@ tru@@ mp@@ eted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temp@@ tation to draw un@@ necessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be dimin@@ ished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform .
I urge the House to support these changes .
Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report , which is a me@@ ticul@@ ous and substan@@ tive piece of work .
the European Union &apos; s structural and cohesion policies are , without doubt , essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social di@@ spar@@ ity between the regions .
despite the steps taken thus far , these levels are still very high , and are un@@ accept@@ ably high as regards unemployment .
these policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thou@@ gh@@ t-@@ out and sensible guidelines .
let us not forget that when these policies are effective , they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life .
let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hin@@ d@@ ran@@ ce to their economic and social development , unless of course the Commission is inten@@ ding to build bridges or under@@ water t@@ unn@@ els linking them to the European main@@ land .
in closing , I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millenn@@ ium , for which we all hope for the best .
Mr President , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter &apos; s report undoubtedly contains several important observations , and I would like to congratulate her on that .
however , I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community &apos; s regional policy .
quite briefly , structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way , rather it ag@@ grav@@ ates it .
the agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irre@@ par@@ ably damaged by the existing regional policy , which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers , particularly in the South .
regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States .
if we examine the data presented in the sixth peri@@ odi@@ c report , we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities .
little consideration , if any at all , has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infra@@ struc@@ ut@@ res structure , transport , communication and energy has resulted in their gradual de@@ population .
the Union &apos; s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy .
a large section of the Union &apos; s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass@@ -@@ roots .
unfortunately , the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented .
Mr President , I would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union .
the first is the fundamental , central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion .
we are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously .
we still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union &apos; s fundamental objectives .
secondly , I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and I would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention .
in future , we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as , in my country , the islands of the Az@@ ores and Madeira .
I would like to ask if the Commission is able to en@@ ligh@@ ten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission &apos; s report on the outermost regions , which has been long awa@@ ited by Parliament ?
Mr President , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur , not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made .
Mr President , Commissioner , the guidelines are intended to help ste@@ er the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes .
however , contrary to their claim to provide guidance , the Commission &apos; s proposals in this respect are re@@ minis@@ cent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas .
nonetheless , their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities .
I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10 , to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects .
I should be very grateful , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliber@@ ations .
Mr President , Commissioner , in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , we uph@@ eld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women .
unfortunately , the excellent Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter report did not take account of this criterion , despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Ber@@ end report - how , in fact , these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most back@@ ward regions in order to bridge the gul@@ f that separ@@ ates them from Europe &apos; s most high@@ ly-@@ developed regions .
they are growing , but only in terms of GDP .
they are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions .
Commissioner , please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority , because this is our citizens &apos; greatest problem .
please take account , in strategic terms , in the revision and in the allocation of reserves , of employment needs , because this , fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require .
Mr President , it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial sev@@ en-@@ year period 2000-@@ 2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation , particularly for women and young people , and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy .
it is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas , employment in rural areas , aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which , of course , comp@@ rise half of the islands of the Union , as stipul@@ ated in Article 15@@ 8 of the Treaty .
cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally dis@@ regards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments , occasion@@ al criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter &apos; s report .
so , ladies and gentlemen , I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before men@@ tioning the principal comments and criticisms that you , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , and the various Members of this House , have made .
regarding the role and structure of these guidelines , Mr H@@ at@@ zi@@ dak@@ is , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter and Mrs Mc@@ Car@@ thy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Ob@@ jec@@ tives 1 , 2 and 3 as well as their links with the Cohesion Funds .
this means putting forward the Commission &apos; s priorities , based on past experience in implementing the programmes , as well as current Community policies relating to structural operations .
the objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use , to the optimum and efficient use , as some of you have wished , of Community involvement , including , Mr Bra@@ d@@ bour@@ n , using , if necessary , the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of European public mon@@ ies .
when I speak of optimum utilis@@ ation , I am referring both to the national and regional levels . and so , Mr Sep@@ pä@@ nen , I shall also mention at this point , speaking of the national level , the link with the Cohesion Fund .
this is the purpose of these guidelines .
regarding their content , as you know , ladies and gentlemen of this House , they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but , at the same time , very passion@@ ately , as I understood her presentation just now .
the first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create , in all sectors , but especially in the private sector , as Mr Ber@@ end said , the maximum number of serious , worthwhile and permanent jobs , the competitiveness of regional economies , all regional economies , and in particular , Mr Evans , that of Wales , but not only of Wales .
and , because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an om@@ is@@ sion , let me also add the regional economies of the European regions han@@ dic@@ apped by their distance from the centre , be they remote regions , island regions or , of course , the most remote regions which are , naturally , the most distant .
perhaps I may inform Mr Ri@@ bei@@ ro e Castro , who asked me about this , that , as I wrote to the pres@@ idents of each of these most remote regions , the Commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report .
concerning the most remote regions , it was only quite bel@@ at@@ edly that we received the memor@@ an@@ dums from the various governments , but this is not necessarily an excuse , just an explanation .
we must therefore take these memor@@ an@@ dums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work .
I myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 November and , within the College , we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions . I would thank you for your understanding in this matter .
so that is the first priority , the competitiveness of regional economies .
the second priority , which several of you have stressed , Mr Puer@@ ta in particular , but there were others , not that I am men@@ tioning them in any order of priority , is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment , particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past .
I particularly remember the time when I was Minister for the Environment in my own country . the second principle is that of equal opportunities , particularly for men and women , as well as the European strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary Union .
finally , and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this House , particularly yourself , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies , for development or re@@ development , which , of all the priorities , offer the maximum opportunity to syn@@ ergy , to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentr@@ alised partnership .
you expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership , yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines .
these are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to them@@ atic priorities , since they must be taken into consideration , under each of the objectives , to different ext@@ ents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the Member States and regions .
I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made , ladies and gentlemen , and firstly on procedure .
it is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date .
let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the Commission , in the form of a draft in February 1999 , in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text , my predec@@ essor , Mrs W@@ ul@@ f-@@ Ma@@ th@@ ies , presented them to Parliament immediately .
due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time , however , Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been defini@@ tively adopted , in July 1999 .
here in this Chamber , ladies and gentlemen , among you , I wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - Mr H@@ at@@ zi@@ dak@@ is asked me a question about this - as far as Member States are concerned , your observations will certainly be taken into consideration .
and let me assure you , furthermore , that when the Commission adop@@ ts the guidelines with what we call the mid-@@ term review in mind , in line with the regulations , then the point of view of this House , as expressed in this report , will also be taken into account .
now to the form .
on the subject of the role of the guidelines , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of European objectives , often very precise ones , should be provided .
I shall not list them all , but they include implementing inter@@ sec@@ toral policies , increasing efficiency in the use of public funds , ass@@ isting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together , etc . the Commission takes note of these , but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents , such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the method@@ ological working document .
drawing to a close , I should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiter@@ ated , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter .
I am thinking , for example , of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations .
this claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring &apos; s negotiations .
the Commission kept to the actual text of Article 10 of the Structural Funds regulations , which stipul@@ ates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide Member States with broad , indic@@ ative guidelines on relevant and agreed Community policies .
I actually quoted the text itself , in quot@@ ation marks .
moreover , the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes .
you then mentioned , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development , pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration .
I find the opposite the case .
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission atta@@ ches , and shall attach , to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy .
indeed , I had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere .
as regards rural development , which a number of you brought up , particularly Mrs Red@@ on@@ do J@@ im@@ é@@ ne@@ z , the guidelines are in line with the tw@@ o@@ fold objective mentioned by your rapporteur : a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas , but also protection of the environment and Europe &apos; s rural heritage .
it must , however , be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the Structural Funds , whose Ob@@ jec@@ tives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversi@@ fication of rural society as a priority .
and indeed , on the subject of the balance of rural society , let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy co@@ financed by the E@@ AG@@ G@@ F Guar@@ ant@@ ee Section , aimed at promoting reform in European agriculture and supporting the multi@@ functional aspect of agriculture .
at this stage , I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrated into the programming for Objective 2 rural areas , in the way that the E@@ AG@@ G@@ F Gu@@ idance Section is for Objective 1 regions .
in any event , I appreciate the vigil@@ ance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter .
I shall therefore reserve the right , if you permit , si@@ r , to give you my own opinion , which , to a great extent , matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil sp@@ il@@ lage using Objective 2 .
I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be appro@@ ving the Objective 2 z@@ oning plans for France , Sweden , Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow .
we shall then have an appropriate tool for working , particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the stor@@ ms .
indeed , this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French departments which have been severely disabled by the stor@@ ms .
in conclusion , with thanks for your understanding , Mr President , I should like to thank you , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , for the quality of your work and that of the committee , and to tell you that I am very pleased , apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines .
we have discussed this and I have attempted to clarify my point of view . I am very pleased with the level of support offered by your House to the Commission in establishing these guidelines , which have been submitted to the Member States for information when establishing their own programmes .
this can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 199@@ 4-@@ 1999 programmes .
I feel this aug@@ urs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions , at this time when programming for the period 2000-@@ 2006 is being undertaken , good joint working practice , which is , Mr H@@ at@@ zi@@ dak@@ is , backed up by something I am very atten@@ tive to : observ@@ ance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m .
social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union
the next item is the debate on the report -LRB- A5-0@@ 10@@ 7 @/@ 1999 -RRB- by Mr Ber@@ end , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the sixth peri@@ odi@@ c report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union -LSB- S@@ EC -LRB- 99 -RRB- 00@@ 66 - C5-0@@ 120 @/@ 99 - 1999 @/@ 2@@ 12@@ 3 -LRB- CO@@ S -RRB- -RSB- .
Mr President , Commissioner , this sixth peri@@ odi@@ c report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constitutes a mil@@ estone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth peri@@ odi@@ c report .
I consider , however , that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-@@ simplified view of the situation and , unfortunately , this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches .
the Commission report generally rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ es this observation , particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest , by which I mean the French overseas departments and , more generally , the most remote regions .
in this respect , I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and , more specifically , to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 2@@ 99 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
finally , in my view , this sixth peri@@ odi@@ c report presents interesting arguments from the view@@ point of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe , particularly when it out@@ lines the importance of relations between the central areas of Europe and its more remote regions .
even if the Commission is still reluct@@ ant to say so in too explicit a fashion , its peri@@ odi@@ c report demonstrates the urgent need to promote poly@@ cent@@ ric development of the Community area through the Union &apos; s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the S@@ EC .
Mr President , the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agrees with the report that Mr Ber@@ end has just presented and congratul@@ ates the author , both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility , which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee .
the European Commission &apos; s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions .
I shall sum@@ mar@@ ise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur , one positive and one negative .
the first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major , although not decisive , factor in reducing regional inequalities .
the negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmon@@ ising the European regions &apos; GDP and productivity than in harmon@@ ising its levels of unemployment .
it is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation .
this , Commissioner , is the first comm@@ and@@ ment for the coming period .
thus , Mr President , I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission , as other speakers have done , to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth peri@@ odi@@ c report when they address the programming for the period 2000-@@ 2006 .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it .
the sixth peri@@ odi@@ cal report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the Union &apos; s regional policy aims . the report shows that growth has been un@@ even , despite all our efforts .
very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe . the strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general European average , whereas many southern European and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly .
we now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas .
is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of inter@@ regional differences , long distances , clim@@ ates that are too cold or too hot , spar@@ se populations and au@@ st@@ ere conditions ?
how can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development ?
it is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union &apos; s more remote areas .
the Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility .
some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased .
this has chi@@ pped away at the results that regional policy has produced .
in the future , we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place .
for example , un@@ controlled migration has not been given sufficient consideration .
in this connection , too , weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development .
it is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how .
our Group is in favour of adopting this report .
Mr President , Commissioner , the European Union &apos; s regional policy has , until now , not been able to interpret , in any significant way , the existing differences in our inhabitants &apos; incomes .
we have a serious situation in which in the European Union today , there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty , as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached , on average , 23.@@ 7 % in the regions worst affected , regions which also happen to be poor areas , whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment , corresponding to the rich@@ er areas , unemployment stands at just 4 % .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Ber@@ end &apos; s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the European Commission in@@ as@@ much as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore .
the over@@ arch@@ ing objectives of the structural funds such as job creation , boo@@ sting equality of opportunity , increasing the sustainability of employment and development , are only mentioned in passing .
this attitude appears to me to be un@@ justified . I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the s@@ eventh peri@@ odi@@ c report .
this does not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness , particularly as I myself am an entreprene@@ ur in an Objective 1 Region , that is in Brand@@ enburg in the Federal Republic of Germany , and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises .
it is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the Objective 1 Reg@@ ions , that is to say job creation measures , special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business .
they are supported by appropriate European Union structural fund activities .
supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development , simply because there is no basis for a self-@@ supporting up@@ turn in these Objective 1 Reg@@ ions .
after all , the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substanti@@ ates the fact than an increase of at least 3 % in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all .
concentr@@ ating to the exclusion of all else on supply and dem@@ and-@@ orient@@ ated economic policy is not the answer .
and those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and , to a less@@ er extent , in ration@@ alisation .
it is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a dem@@ and-@@ orient@@ ated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas .
the situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions .
in other words , what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there .
for example , these would be measures for vocational training , for further education , for re-@@ integrating people who have already been excluded from the production process , for the flexi@@ bil@@ isation of working time and working time arrangements , in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again .
Mr President , my compli@@ ments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report .
the key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union .
by stimulating a diversity of investments , the European Union is endeavo@@ uring to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment .
from the sixth peri@@ odi@@ c report on the regions , one can draw the hes@@ it@@ ant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect .
the efforts made in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase , not really a satis@@ fying result over a period during which , certainly over the past couple of years , there has been economic growth .
as indicated by the rapporteur , the effects of the structural measures , on the other hand , are minimal as far as employment is concerned .
some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for .
also , the observation that the disparities between regions within Member States sometimes even become more pron@@ ounced raises serious questions .
Mr President , it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities , especially in connection with boo@@ sting employment .
it is , after all , they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their re@@ mit .
by allowing them to develop tail@@ or-@@ made plans for the relevant regions and , if necessary , t@@ ying this in with financial aid , a higher return can be achieved .
surely this must be the ultimate goal .
I am therefore in favour of the Commission deleg@@ ating the practical details and implementation of measures to the Member States and regions .
following on from this , it is probably also more meaningful , with regard to the financial aid to regions , to give Member States more say anyway .
by shi@@ fting the criteria from the regions to the Member States , we can avoid a great deal of problems later on .
finally , I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries .
the report shows that , in general , they are a long way behind EU countries , especially in terms of GDP per capita .
with the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the fores@@ e@@ eable future , it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy .
I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later .
Mr President , Commissioner , following close scrutiny of this report one can not escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part .
for example , whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decre@@ ased , there has been a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect .
equally , unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all , indeed they rose in some cases .
I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently .
even the accum@@ ulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries .
since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment , then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development , improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training .
genuine structural reforms and a competi@@ tion-@@ friendly taxation policy are the cornerst@@ ones of a successful economic base .
if we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-@@ intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term , then the measures drawn up so far must be analy@@ sed .
we will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate .
Mr President , Commissioner , my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report , because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of Europe will judge that we have been successful in our work .
this issue , which has an impact on their everyday life , is a key issue as regards EU credibility .
it has to be conc@@ eded that the EU has already ai@@ ded , I would say quite magnific@@ ently , the development of poor countries .
I remember what Portugal and Greece used to be like when I dro@@ ve through those countries for the first time twenty-@@ five years ago .
in this connection , French speakers would speak of a `` cou@@ p de chap@@ eau &apos;&apos; : in other words , I take my hat off to the EU .
the EU really deserves such a gest@@ ure , but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great .
what is the result ?
people react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a cr@@ ust .
consequently , we have to build schools , hospitals , and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over .
this is very costly and it also causes very great social problems .
most people , however , would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised , if they were given the chance to , in other words , if there was work there .
we must give them this opportunity .
this is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have .
the solution , as I see it , lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneur@@ ship .
by entrepreneur@@ ship I do not simply mean the ownership of business , but creating will .
I mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life , whether he or she is an employee , the owner of a business or an official .
what is a fair society ?
one in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children .
in this way , positive development of the regions is also possible , because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance .
finally , I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America , where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of en@@ v@@ y , as it often is here in Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner , as my time is limited , I shall get straight to the point .
firstly , let me make a statement of fact : the fruits of growth are not distributed equ@@ itably within the Union .
the most remote regions , still hard hit by catastro@@ phic unemployment rates , offer one example of this .
in Re@@ union , for example , the rate is 37 % .
this is not a situation related to the economic climate , however ; rather it is a structural problem , created by our re@@ mot@@ eness , our insul@@ arity , in short , our own specific personality .
the principle of specific , exceptional treatment was envisaged in Article 2@@ 99 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to deal with such cases .
it only remains to put this principle into practice .
the Commission document expected to be ready in December 1999 was delayed until January , then February , and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optim@@ ism .
I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission .
as regards taxation , state aid , the Structural Funds and defending our traditional products , practical measures characterised by dar@@ ing and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency .
if these do not materi@@ alise , then , unfortunately , convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us , and it is to be fear@@ ed that the structural policy undertaken in our regions , despite the size of the amounts committed , will end in failure .
thank you very much , Commissioner .

adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
the Minutes of yesterday &apos; s sitting have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
Mr President , I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the Minutes .
I refer to item 11 on the order of business .
firstly , I believe the issue raised by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the rein@@ statement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-@@ year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommod@@ ated .
I wish to express that view even if I resp@@ ect@@ fully dis@@ agreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group .
the second point I would like to make - and which I would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament , as other speakers re@@ marked yesterday , can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and syn@@ ergy with the European Commission .
there is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this .
when there are major set@@ -@@ piece debates scheduled between this House and the European Commission in the future , we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance .
there needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this House and then between this House and the Commission .
we should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fra@@ c@@ ture in institutional relationships .
looking at some of the press reports of last Friday , I believe that the Commission and its President exerc@@ ised comm@@ end@@ able self-@@ res@@ tra@@ int in the way they comm@@ ented publicly .
that is something for which I have a deep appreciation .
I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a mis@@ ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions .
it should not be dram@@ ati@@ sed into something more than that .
thank you very much , Mr Cox .
I understand what you are saying .
we have taken note of this .
Mr President , concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business , we agreed yesterday to have the Bour@@ langes report on today &apos;s agenda .
however , it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on .
it therefore needs to be withdrawn from today &apos;s agenda .
Mr W@@ ynn , that makes sense .
the report is her@@ eby withdrawn from the agenda .
Mr President , regarding Mrs Lyn@@ ne &apos;s comments yesterday about health and safety in this building , I pres@@ ume she was talking about the dra@@ ins because there is a d@@ read@@ ful sm@@ ell of dra@@ ins on the fifth floor in the Tower .
this needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong .
I do not want to drag up the issue of this building end@@ lessly , but this is a serious problem .
Mrs Ah@@ ern , we have taken note of this .
I would ask you to bring this specific case , which has to do with the ven@@ ti@@ lat@@ ors on a particular floor , to the attention of the Qu@@ a@@ est@@ ors , who are , in fact , responsible for the matter .
we will also pass this on to our services , however .
thank you very much .

Mr President , Commissioner , today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union &apos; s competition policy .
we are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law , that is Mr von W@@ og@@ au &apos; s report , and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe .
I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission &apos; s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term `` modernisation &apos;&apos; to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper , or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression `` retro@@ grade step &apos;&apos; .
however , we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998 , and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter .
but , of course , both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper .
it is all about the need for modernisation and the future vi@@ ability of the European competition policy .
on reading both Commission documents , one lear@@ ns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed , which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us .
allow me to make two fundamental comments at this junc@@ ture . as the competent authority , the Commission , with its log@@ ically consistent approach , has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition , not always to the del@@ ight of the Member States or enterprises concerned .
it should continue along this path .
but , Commissioner , none of this is to become less complicated in future - one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the Union , the deep@@ ening of the internal market , technological progress , globalisation .
indeed , it is not just about modernisation of Community law , more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases , about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions , for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population &apos; s acceptance , together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned .
only , without transparency there will be no acceptance , indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency .
the competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but , in fact , there is nothing that could not be further improved upon .
our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought , Commissioner , but there is one point that I would just like to go into now . transparency and accountability belong together .
I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question .
the Commission is the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role , for the sake of its own independence ; but Parliament is a supervisory body , and what better forum could there be in which to ex@@ po@@ und the reason@@ ing behind one &apos; s decisions than a democrati@@ call@@ y-@@ elected Parliament , indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion ?
here too we should continue along the path we have chosen , strengthening and intensi@@ fying it .
there is one thing I would like to make quite clear though . Parliament is a legislative body , but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law , of all things , is truly sc@@ andal@@ ous .
therefore , I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area .
I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doub@@ tful cases , even given the Treaty status quo .
I also expect the Commission to be pro-@@ active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures .
this will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions .
with all due respect for the principle of competition , competition is not , however , an end in itself .
competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions .
at the end of the day , one of the fundamental ten@@ ets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ide@@ olo@@ gue .
competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts .
but optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own acc@@ ord .
framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses , monopolies law being one example .
but on the whole , this only serves to prevent abuses ; framework conditions alone can not achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation .
competition yes , restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible .
however , since state aid forms the lion &apos; s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like , regardless of Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er &apos; s report , to say one more thing about it . it is certainly possible , indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educ@@ ating them in regional and environmental policy .
indeed it must be per@@ missible for state aid to be provided for such purposes , provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition .
this is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mer@@ gers law for decisions to be comprehensible .
it is not just that we should p@@ ill@@ ory state aid ; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinc@@ tions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the ab@@ ov@@ e-@@ mentioned objectives .
my last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission &apos; s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87 , 88 and 89 of the Treaties .
the Commission report is essentially a descri@@ p@@ tive report detail@@ ing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors , according to various ty@@ po@@ lo@@ gi@@ es , such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued .
to put it pl@@ ain@@ ly , the level of state aid declared , roughly speaking , is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1.2 % of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent , coinci@@ dentally , of the Community budget for one year .
this being the case , there are considerable disparities between states , which may be measured in various ways , such as , for example , as a percentage of added value and per wage ear@@ ner .
I think it is also interesting to add state aid and Community aid , which may be as@@ simil@@ ated in some way into state aid .
this clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the Cohesion Fund , among other things , which come at the top of the list .
this being the case , let me now come to the proposals made in the report .
we note , first of all , that the committee considers the data , as presented in the Commission &apos; s annual report , to be in too aggreg@@ ated a form to enable an in-depth evaluation of state aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate , sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of competition , pursuant to the actual terms of the Treaty .
the Commission can only coll@@ ate and analyse the data provided by the Member States .
it is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided , and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect .
it is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example , has champ@@ ion@@ ed the long@@ standing idea of a public register of state aid , accessible via the Internet .
having better , more detailed information available , particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded , must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies .
and insofar as such studies already exist , to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the Treaties , which are not only to ensure the competi@@ tivity of the European economy , but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion .
by stres@@ sing , primarily , the quality of the information provided , our debate in committee , and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you , avoided a simpl@@ istic response in the form of an a pri@@ ori statement that the level of state aid was , in absolute terms , either too high or not high enough .
most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between , on the one hand , the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and , on the other hand , acknowled@@ gement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Treaty , particularly , as I have said already , as regards sustainable development , research and development and economic and social cohesion .
this being the case , various amendments to the rapporteur &apos; s initial draft report were adopted in committee , particularly highligh@@ ting the need for effective reimbur@@ sement of aid found to be illegal as well as the establishment of a le@@ ague table of results .
seven amendments have been ret@@ abled for this plenary sitting .
most of them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropri@@ at@@ eness and effectiveness of state aid , in view of the in@@ adequ@@ acies , acknowledged or not , of private investment alone , the market failures or in@@ adequ@@ acies of the market .
there is in particular one amendment , let me point out , concerning the energy sector , which , in my capacity as rapporteur , I see as particularly important .
I should like to conclude this presentation , Commissioner , by stres@@ sing two things : firstly , a concern of the members of the committee and , secondly , a demand of our committee .
the concern involves the pre-@@ accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , in terms of competition policy and state aid .
this is undoubtedly a complex issue , and one where we should like to see the Commission inform@@ ing us of the latest development in the matter , particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and , as far as state aid is concerned , the need , in all prob@@ ability , to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors .
and finally , in conclusion , our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing , competition policy and state aid , in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference .
as you know , Commissioner , our report argu@@ es that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid .
Mr President , Commissioner , my contribution to today &apos; s debate concerns the steel aid code , that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission .
there were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these .
the EC@@ SC Treaty is due to exp@@ ire shortly .
hence , what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future .
the European Commission &apos; s decisions , which feature in the report , are welcomed by the European Parliament , as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases , thus applying Article 88 of the EC@@ SC Treaty .
the competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission &apos; s most recent communication , which we have not yet debated in Parliament .
as in other sectors , the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry .
according to this article , state aid is irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able with the common market , in principle .
exemp@@ tions are only permitted in precisely defined cases .
under Article 88 , the Commission is obliged to supervis@@ e state aid .
in 1998 , the largest case concerned the supply of company capital tot@@ alling EUR 5@@ 40 million to the PR@@ EU@@ SS@@ AG in Germany .
furthermore , the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid .
the rules per@@ taining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996 .
these sti@@ p@@ ulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular , precis@@ el@@ y-@@ defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development , aid for environmental protection , social security to ease the closure of ste@@ el@@ works and aid to help non-@@ competitive enterprises cease trading altogether .
in addition , there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece .
however , there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report .
as far as Parliament is concerned , it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has exp@@ ired .
there must be no water@@ ing-@@ down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code .
no one wants an un@@ imp@@ eded subsi@@ dy competition in Europe .
this would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market , regardless of the fact that the steel industry has under@@ gone consolidation in the past few years .
consequently , Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry &apos; s claims about un@@ equal treatment , and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations .
we all know that so far the Council has dra@@ gged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind .
the reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code exp@@ ires , they will be able to do their own thing again without the in@@ convenience of the European Commission &apos; s supervision .
we therefore demand that once the Treaty exp@@ ires , steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94 , for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity .
this is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code .
a Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments .
what we need to avoid doing in the future is com@@ promising competition conditions and distur@@ bing the balance in the markets .
we also need to critic@@ ise the Commission &apos; s practice of appro@@ ving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view , do not fall within the categories of the code , even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this un@@ equal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned .
the Commission will be called upon , in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999 , to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elabor@@ ation of restructuring plans and approved exemp@@ tions , thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made .
once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two ab@@ sten@@ tions , I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity , which we have ourselves created , in plenary sitting .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the internal market is not complete .
subsidies , monopolies and barriers to competition are still imp@@ eding markets and development alike .
national governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time , but then it happens again .
subsidies dist@@ ort al@@ locations , both within and between countries .
a succ@@ essive phas@@ ing out of State aid is required , and more and more markets must be opened up to competition . this applies to those which have been turned into monopolies , both private and public .
public monopolies are , more often than not , phas@@ ed out reluct@@ antly .
increased competition and newly established organisations should be able to provide significant benefits in terms of welfare , including within the sp@@ heres of education , health care and social services .
public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures .
Europe must be modern@@ ised , made more entrepreneur@@ ial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies .
effective competition push@@ es prices down and raises standards of living .
it is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently . in fact , competition policy and consumer policy belong together .
the internal market is the basis for our work .
its legislation is to apply equally to all , to large and small countries alike .
a systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be disman@@ tled . the EU &apos; s own regulations too may therefore need to be analy@@ sed .
the new model now being tested by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nation@@ alisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy .
in order to be effective , it must be well anch@@ ored in the Member States &apos; national authorities .
in six months &apos; time , it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation &apos; s effects upon the Commission &apos; s role .
the question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter-@@ institutional congress which will open up an un@@ bi@@ ased debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests .
this will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to return to the more radical changes which have been discussed . there will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate .
the law must be correctly applied in matters of competition .
wron@@ g@@ ly applied competition policy may cause losses in the legal sphere and inter@@ fere with the right of ownership , which is an important and basic principle we should stand up for .
we have a quite exciting debate in front of us .
a conference where the issues are properly debated will make it possible to stra@@ igh@@ ten out mis@@ understand@@ ings , at the same time as perhaps improving upon certain points .
Parliament and the Commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens .
in fact , in my own constituency of Stockholm , we have many good local examples of increased supply and improved quality which have ar@@ isen precisely because of exposure to competition in areas which were previously total monopolies .
we would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by Mr von W@@ og@@ au and Mr Rap@@ k@@ ay .
we hope that the legal points of view will also be accord@@ ed the importance which is only reasonable in a state based on the rule of law .
Mr President , as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my ma@@ iden speech here today , even though there has been a delay .
I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von W@@ og@@ au , Mr Lan@@ gen , Mr Rap@@ k@@ ay and Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er , as well as the Commission , for their excellent cooperation .
competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story ; take the energy and telecommunications sectors , where there has been a demonstr@@ able lower@@ ing of prices and improvement in quality of service .
all this is to the good of the consumer .
but we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further .
the Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points : dro@@ pping the obligation to notify and retro@@ displac@@ ement of law enforcement .
dro@@ pping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs , at any rate .
at the same time , this change of system will also lead to more on@@ us being placed on the individual in the business world , of course .
it will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved ; for one thing , each person will have to take responsibility themselves , and that is probably why there is un@@ ease about this in other quarters .
however I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a mark@@ er for less red tape .
the second point relates to the retro@@ displac@@ ement of law enforcement .
if we are to create a culture of law in Europe , then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the Commission , by central bodies , but also by national authorities , by national courts .
we are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally , it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty .
it will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have re@@ course to the Commission in this matter .
the way to a European monopolies commission must be kept clear , something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion .
but we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy .
Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could as@@ certain what state aid is being granted , then this would encourage the Member States to be more discipl@@ ined .
however , when it comes to what the future holds for competition , there are two issues dear to my heart .
one is subsidiarity .
we all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency , and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions .
competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weak@@ en the European Union .
I would c@@ ite , by way of example , the issue of job creation schemes , savings banks and regional banks , and Gü@@ tes@@ i@@ egel .
here , a region has , by its own efforts , created a means of marketing its own products .
this own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention .
I believe there is also a need to raise the de minim@@ is regulation .
we should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other .
my second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy , although I am not going to talk about market failure just now .
I have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector , but I would just like to focus on a matter one h@@ ears again and again in certain quarters .
these days , someone who lives in an old people &apos; s home is accommod@@ ated within the social field .
however , I could also regard them as a customer , and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field , that is evol@@ ved structures , sti@@ f@@ le competition .
apart from that , I could refer to any customers , any sector , as customers , and thereby have a highly destruc@@ tive effect on social fields .
to conclude , I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity . I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes , they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to acro@@ ss@@ - the-@@ board regulation by Europe .
thank you very much , Mr Rad@@ wan .
I would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in German parliament@@ ar@@ y-@@ speak , in@@ appropriately in your case , as a ma@@ iden speech .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Member , Robert Go@@ eb@@ bels , who is unable to attend due to a political commitment .
within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , the Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er report has given rise to bitter contro@@ vers@@ y on the subject of the operation of the market .
a sli@@ m right-@@ wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures .
even if the majority in this House were to adhere to this ul@@ tr@@ ali@@ ber@@ al idea of a sup@@ pos@@ edly perfect market , it would not make any difference to the real world .
economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources .
while , since the da@@ wn of time , the market has been the key forum for human inter@@ change , it has never been perfect .
the market favo@@ urs the short term and immediate profits .
on the market , the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weak@@ est parties , consumers and workers .
in order to function , the market needs rules .
the necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society .
we European Socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose .
the market is not an end in itself ; it must help to improve the human condition .
the European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operators , but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion .
finally , aid can enable restructuring , offer training , save jobs and thus know-how .
the main objective of the Union &apos; s competition policy can not be to reduce the overall level of aid .
this aid must be align@@ ed with the objectives of the Union , particularly economic and social cohesion , sustainable development and research .
the Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hin@@ ders the internal market .
it would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid .
the Internet is not a product of the market , but the result of research financed by the American army .
the World Wi@@ de Web , which has enabled the met@@ e@@ or@@ ic development of the information society , was developed by C@@ ER@@ N in Geneva , once again with public aid .
the German Government &apos; s intervention to save the Holz@@ mann group was criticised as an un@@ justi@@ fiable constra@@ int upon the market economy .
President Du@@ isen@@ berg even attempted to attri@@ bute the weakness , the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interven@@ tion@@ ism .
I did not hear Mr Du@@ isen@@ berg critic@@ ising the intervention of the American monetary authorities to save the h@@ edge fund , LT@@ C@@ M .
wishing to save 60 000 jobs is , apparently , a s@@ in against the market , but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market .
public mon@@ ies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation , as was the case in Mexico , Asia and Brazil .
human labour , on the other hand , is considered to be a simple factor in the equ@@ ation .
we Socialists reject the liber@@ als &apos; na@@ ï@@ ve optim@@ ism on this point .
we want a true culture of competition in Europe .
the state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the Commission must act as judge .
Mr President , Commissioner , I want to begin by thanking Mr Rap@@ k@@ ay for a good report and constructive cooperation .
I want to thank you , Commissioner Monti , for your outstanding cooperation and I want to tell you that , as we enter the new millenn@@ ium , you have an especially important role . it is your job to ti@@ dy up the m@@ ess left by national governments .
these may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy , but their capacity to w@@ re@@ ak ha@@ vo@@ c seems bound@@ less .
let me mention the latest examples we have seen : Holz@@ mann , a company which receives considerable aid from the German Government ; sa@@ w@@ mil@@ ls in former East Germany ; and , especially , aid to ship@@ yards .
these are three areas in which many Danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squ@@ ee@@ zed out of their markets .
I want to say to Mr P@@ oos that I very much agree with Mr Du@@ isen@@ berg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to restruc@@ ture their economies and , to that extent , are helping to undermine the value of the euro .
the Group of the European Liberal , Democ@@ rat and Reform Party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee , all concerning state aid .
these are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness , which is very important with a view to making the internal market work .
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Liberal , Democ@@ rat and Reform Party .
as I say , our amendments concern transparency , and I should like to emphasise the amendment which ur@@ ges the Commission to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state ai@@ ds we consider to be lawful , specifically in order to ensure that companies can predic@@ t what their situation will be .
another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared un@@ lawful .
how do we ensure that un@@ lawful state aid is paid back ?
at present , there are no common rules in this area , and we vigor@@ ously urge the Commission to make a point of harmon@@ ising the rules on re@@ payment .
this is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition .
finally , we propose keeping both a register , as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs , and also a sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid .
you have shown us the way , Mr Monti , with the single market sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard .
it was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid .
I very much hope that you , Commissioner Monti , will support these amendments , and I look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter .
to conclude , I want to welcome the Commission &apos; s X@@ VI@@ II@@ th Report on Com@@ petition Policy , on which , once again , a good deal of work has been done .
but , as I have already mentioned , our over@@ riding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness .
there is still a need to tigh@@ ten up in the areas mentioned , and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resol@@ utely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid .
this is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union , and I should like to thank Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er who , in his report , has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria , as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition .
as Liberals and Greens , we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look , but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives , and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems .
Mr President , Commissioner , there are just two questions which must be answered .
are state aid to business or inter-@@ company agreements legitimate in a market economy , and who must supervis@@ e these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy ?
regarding the first point , we say quite clearly that , in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed , it is essential that , in some instances , there is state aid to businesses , be it in the form of tax exemp@@ tions , special taxation or even direct aid .
it is also legitimate for there to be inter-@@ company agreements and voluntary res@@ tra@@ int agreements , since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detri@@ mental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements .
so our clear response is that , yes , such aid and such agreements are legitimate , but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified .
the von W@@ og@@ au report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level .
we feel this is relatively dangerous , but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission can not do everything .
we demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact .
Mr President , once again we are debating the European Union &apos; s competition policy .
but let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us .
the over@@ riding features of today &apos; s economy are massive mer@@ gers and acquis@@ i@@ tions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ingly powerful multinational groups .
should we not be discussing this issue ?
we need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these priv@@ ate-@@ sector monopolies .
certain sectors of European industry , such as the ship@@ building industry , air transport and the steel industry , which have been hard hit by existing competition policy , have suffered tremend@@ ously .
they have lost their status , and a significant sli@@ ce of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redund@@ ant .
when will we debate that ?
the sc@@ andal@@ ous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving spec@@ ulative multinational groups economies the size of entire states , and Member States of the Union at that .
and yet , we keep on weak@@ ening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tigh@@ ten competition policy yet further by quali@@ fying public procurement contracts placed with public@@ -@@ sector corporations as state aid .
at the same time , unemployment is spir@@ alling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs .
workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights .
consumers see their standard of living being ero@@ ded , poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the Union being disman@@ tled and dis@@ solved in the name of un@@ adul@@ ter@@ ated and catastro@@ phic competition , in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopo@@ lis@@ tic interests of big business .
we consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it .
Mr President , Commissioner , in the course of this pi@@ vot@@ al year , prior to the chan@@ ge@@ over to the single currency , the Commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment .
the competition policy has , as far as these resources permitted , contributed to this event .
for our part , we remain staun@@ ch@@ ly opposed to the single currency which , far from bringing us the advantages and flexibility of a shared currency , impris@@ ons us in an artificial stra@@ it@@ jack@@ et , which has been imposed on the peoples of Europe .
having said that , governing means planning . it also means being responsible and , in this new context which has been forced upon us , competition law naturally has an essential role to play .
in this area , the Commission has given priority to a number of routes of action : acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti-@@ competitive practices , by re@@ focusing its departments &apos; supervisory activities only upon matters with a mani@@ fest Community interest and by affir@@ ming its intention to modern@@ ise competition law .
as regards state aid , it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex , and the introduction of a public register , where all aid would be recorded , does not seem advis@@ able to us since this on@@ er@@ ous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints .
finally , on the subject of modern@@ ising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty , we do not think that decentr@@ alised application would necessarily be going in the right direction .
the Commission is , in fact , re@@ taining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities , but clearly oblig@@ ing the national juris@@ dic@@ tions to avoid disp@@ uting the decisions of the Commission at all .
national states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regarding observ@@ ance of the application of rules which they do not control .
in conclusion , I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction , we shall of course remain vigil@@ ant in order to prevent the snow@@ ball@@ ing of Feder@@ alism which , if it were realised , would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states .
Mr President , Commissioner , we have a basically positive view of the Commission &apos; s White Paper on competition , particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation , but we are also pu@@ zz@@ led by several things .
in this respect , we should he@@ ed the words of von Ei@@ eck , and doub@@ tless also those of the great Italian liberal Brun@@ o Le@@ oni , who war@@ ned precisely against the risks of an ab@@ normal increase in anti-@@ competition policies .
state interference in the economy is , even today , still to blame for the most serious hin@@ d@@ ran@@ ces placed in the way of the market , competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers .
there is State aid for businesses - we have already discussed this , there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the Italian T@@ reas@@ ury controls 15 % of stock exchange capit@@ alisation ; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mer@@ gers and acquis@@ i@@ tions ; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one &apos; s bid for Mann@@ es@@ mann and the b@@ ail@@ out of Holz@@ mann .
finally , Commissioner , we can not forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state , ranging from state television , which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpay@@ er , and the Post Office , to some compulsory insurance schemes , including health and social welfare systems , which are managed by in@@ efficient state monopolies which leave no-@@ one but the weal@@ thy user with any other option .
Commissioner , I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties , but I believe that , it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy , especially because of in@@ sufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition .
what is being done may well be very important , but it is still not sufficient .
Mr President , we are holding a special debate : on competition policy and state aid , the government &apos; s right and left hand , so to speak .
whilst the EMU criteria are forcing Member States to cur@@ b expenditure , the high level of state aid to industry has so far remained in place .
this is understandable , because it is highly likely that Member States which start to cut back on state aid will cause companies to leave , with adverse effects on employment .
but , at the same time , this is not understandable because bad management and non-@@ viable jobs should not be funded by taxpayers &apos; money .
in principle , only horizontal regulations are per@@ missible because they do not dist@@ ort , or hardly dist@@ ort , competition .
the rapporteur &apos; s Amendments Nos 6 and 7 , therefore , deserve our support .
amendments Nos 1 and 5 make reference to the phenomenon of market failure because the market instrument in itself does not result in the ideal society .
vulnerable people find themselves har@@ dest hit .
market forces must be employed in a sophisticated manner to do full justice to the responsibility of citizens and companies .
if this comes to nothing , then the government has to step in .
the Commission &apos; s White Paper on modern@@ ising competition policy seems more like a discussion paper .
the ple@@ a in favour of decentr@@ alisation in order to ligh@@ ten the load within the Director@@ ate-@@ General on Com@@ petition is a kind gest@@ ure , but the way in which the Commission would like to carry this through would lead to the judiciary being stret@@ ched .
this would be at the expense of legal certainty within industry .
does the pressure of work within the Commission really decrease when national judges are required to report to the Commission ?
what is the Council &apos; s opinion on this and is the Commissioner prepared to completely re@@ consider these points ?
Mr President , a White Paper , by definition , is not something you can take or leave .
it is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that .
it forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense .
I understand where the authors are coming from and I share their views .
I also assume that you , Commissioner , want to honour the reputation of , and the work put in by , your predec@@ essors and that your offices will pursue the same objective .
I can not imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-@@ Europe@@ an@@ ise or re-@@ nation@@ alise in a thorough manner , but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless .
