INFO: SOURCE: ebenso wie meine Vorredner bin ich der Meinung , daß die Berichte des Rechnungshofes der ganzen Sache eine neue Dringlichkeit verleihen . nebenbei sei erwähnt , daß wir Parlamentarier diese Entwicklung im Rahmen des Berichts von Professor Tsatsos , der bereits auf die dringende Notwendigkeit eines rechtlichen Status für die Parteien verwiesen hatte , voraus@@ gesehen haben . 
INFO: TARGET: I share the concern of other speakers that the reports of the Court of Auditors - which , by the way , we fully anticipated in this House several years ago with the report of Professor Tsatsos , which pointed out the urgent necessity of vali@@ dating parties in statutory terms - adds a new urgency . 
INFO: SAMPLE: now , like my previous reason , I note that the position of the Court of Auditors by accept a new resolution , which is the reason for a comment , highlights that we had majority MEPs opportunity to raise measures which you refer to since Lord Tsatsos because , on the future , we have already seen the urgent need for a legal event to be made of the parties . 
INFO: SOURCE: übrig geblieben ist der Artikel 5. Ich meine , daß wir im Rahmen dieser Regierungskonferenz Überlegungen anstellen sollten , ob der Artikel 5 nicht als Protokoll zum EU @-@ Vertrag genommen werden kann und ob man es nicht jedem Mitgliedstaat überlassen soll , in souveräner Entscheidung festzulegen , ob er diesem Protokoll zustimmt oder nicht .   
INFO: TARGET: all that remains is Article 5 . I think this Intergovernmental Conference should consider whether Article 5 can be adopted in the form of a protocol to the EU Treaty and whether we should leave it to each Member State to take a sovereign decision as to whether or not it subscri@@ bes to this protocol . 
INFO: SAMPLE: it is absolutely that , even while I believe , the amendment should be made into the form of a IGC to refer not to Rule 5 of the Treaty to Rule 5 , sufficiently to court every Member State if we were to give any choices to Parliament , on the one hand , either the protocol does not answer or not ? 
INFO: SOURCE: es ist sicher eine gute Absicht , sich auch für die Gesundheit von Rau@@ chern in Drittländern verantwortlich fühlen zu wollen . wenn dieses S@@ end@@ ungs@@ bewußtsein aber dazu führt , daß die Tabakindustrie ihre für den Export in Drittländer bestimmte Produktion dahin verlegt , haben wir lediglich den Abbau von Arbeitsplätzen erreicht .    
INFO: TARGET: wanting to accept a sense of responsibility for the health of smokers in third countries is obviously well meant , but when this sense of mission@@ ary purpose results in the tobacco industry relocating production intended for export to third countries outside the EU , then all we will have managed to achieve are job losses . 
INFO: SAMPLE: I certainly appreciate that our role would be to do our goal for the health of trees in third countries to guarantee that what Saf@@ h me has accordingly lead to discourage farmers in particular production for the export of third countries to companies such as production shops . 
INFO: SOURCE: wenn schließlich auch eben wieder argumentiert wird , der Kosovo @-@ Krieg habe gezeigt , daß die EU eine größere militärische Unabhängigkeit von den USA benö@@ tige , so ist meiner Meinung nach dazu festzustellen , daß eine Militarisierung der internationalen Beziehungen und des sicherheitspolitischen Denkens die Abhängigkeit von den USA nicht verringern sondern verstärken wird .  
INFO: TARGET: finally , when it is again argued that the war in Kosovo demonstrated that the EU needs major military independence from the USA then , to my mind , this begs the conclusion that milit@@ arising international relations and security policy will increase , not reduce dependency on the USA .       
INFO: SAMPLE: once again , although the UK atrocities turned currency conflicts have repeatedly responded to the verifiable break@@ ep@@ on@@ ance of EU military independence in recent words , I feel that being clear enough for Europe &apos; s debt ( convince the Federal United States of the US . 
INFO: SOURCE: zum anderen bleibe ich überzeugt , daß der Krieg gegen Jugoslawien mit konsequenter , präven@@ tiver und langfristiger Politik hätte vermieden werden können und müssen , zumal es sich in diesen Tagen erneut und dramatisch zeigt , daß sein angeb@@ liches oder tatsäch@@ liches Ziel , die Menschen- und Minderheitenrechte zu gewährleisten , katastrophal verfehlt wurde .  
INFO: TARGET: secondly , I am convinced that the war against Yugoslavia could and should have been avoided with a consistent , preventive , long @-@ term policy , especially as events over the last few days have again shown dramatically that its alleged or actual aim of safeguarding human and minority rights failed disast@@ ro@@ us@@ ly . 
INFO: SAMPLE: I must not feel convinced that the war against Yugoslavia can be created , as well as my willingness to avoid . 
INFO: SOURCE: wir waren vor einigen Tagen bei der NATO @-@ Versammlung , und der Präsident der Nord@@ atlantischen Versammlung hat dort gesagt : &quot; die Weste@@ uropäische Union geht in der Europäischen Union auf . die EU hat ein Parlament .                   
INFO: TARGET: we attended the NATO assembly a few days ago , where the president of the North Atlantic assembly stated that the Western European Union was merging into the European Union , that the EU had a parliament , that NATO had a parliament and that the WEU assembly therefore had no further raison d &apos; être . 
INFO: SAMPLE: until 1985 the United Nations Assembly in Foreign Affairs , Conservatives , exempting the Western European Union in the European Union concerning the Union in Europe , and a Parliament . 
INFO: SOURCE: wir müssen mit diesem Vertrag auch dafür sorgen , daß die Entscheidungs@@ mechanismen verbessert werden , und wir dürfen die großen Mängel nicht vergessen , die im Organisations@@ des@@ aster im Kosovo zum Ausdruck kommen , die Grund für die mangelnde Waffen@@ export@@ politik sind und die Einheitlichkeit im EU @-@ Vertrag bisher verhindert haben .   
INFO: TARGET: we must also ensure that this Treaty improves our decision @-@ making mechanisms and we should not forget the huge shortcomings brought to light in the organisational disaster in Kosovo , which are the reason for the lack of an arms export policy and which have so far fore@@ stalled unity in the EU Treaty .  
INFO: SAMPLE: let us ask for this procedure to improve decisions and we should not forget the large shortcomings that will risk under the FAO &apos;s short level of alleviating the loss of arms imported : the real nature of Euro @-@ exports trading policy has created difficulties before us . 
INFO: SOURCE: es war klug , als Ziel die Integration der Westeuropäischen Union in die Europäische Union vorzugeben , und deshalb sind diese Debatten so absurd , die im Moment innerhalb der Westeuropäischen Union stattfinden . man versucht , dort neue Legitim@@ ationen für die parlamentarische Versammlung der Westeuropäischen Union zu erfinden .        
INFO: TARGET: it was clever to pretend that the aim is to integrate the Western European Union in the European Union , which is why the debates currently being held within the Western European Union are so absurd , trying as they are to invent a new identity for the parliamentary assembly of the Western European Union .  
INFO: SAMPLE: it has been intelligent , the process within the European Union considered a development of the Western EU within the European Union , so these debates which are currently here in the Western EU will have tried to revive , in breach of a new civil solution for the European Union did not potentially aspire to this Commission . 
INFO: SOURCE: sieb@@ tens und abschließend : wir sind uns ebenfalls bewußt , daß wir bis zum Inkrafttreten eines europäischen Parteien@@ statuts Übergangsregelungen brauchen , die die Unterstützung europäischer politischer Parteien durch die Fraktionen im Europäischen Parlament regeln und begrenzen . wir sind hier zu einer breiten , fraktions@@ übergreifenden Initiative bereit .        
INFO: TARGET: Seventh and lastly : we are also aware that , until such time as a European party statute enters into force , we need transitional rules regulating and limiting support for European political parties by groups in the European Parliament and we are prepared to take a broad initiative here which crosses the group divide .

INFO: SOURCE: ich möchte nicht behaupten , daß die politischen Parteien der einzige und auch nicht unbedingt der wichtigste Kanal sind , über welchen die Bürger Einfluß auf die Gesch@@ ic@@ ke in der heutigen Gesellschaft nehmen können , aber sie haben darin ihren Platz , und die Stellung der europäischen Parteien muß rasch definiert werden .    
INFO: TARGET: I do not want to say that the political parties are the only , or even necessarily , the most important channel whereby the public can have a say in matters that currently affect society , but they play a part , and the status of the European parties must be defined without delay .   
INFO: SAMPLE: I am not delighted to say that the political situation is all the most important for us , which are not as a great cost of the World sympathy that can be expressed by supporting European and the citizens who can shape home today while it has its road , and that the sort of European positions should be clarified as a means of reform .

INFO: TARGET: the question of income for older people depends on the extent to which we retain the European social model of a contribution from people who are in work to those who , at various points in their lives , either through illness or old age , will no longer be able to take part in the workforce .     
INFO: SAMPLE: the issue of the income of elderly people is based , whether we are dealing with protecting the European social model , which the latter is that people who work in work to help meet those people who are directly in with more life and just again or the pretext of using and slaughter or damaging workers .

INFO: SOURCE: Herr Präsident , Frau Kommissarin , werte Kolleginnen und Kollegen ! mit diesem Bericht - für den ich Frau de Sarnez danken möchte - ist für die Europäische Union der Zeitpunkt gekommen , über ihr Konzept vom Recht auf Bildung - und genauer vom Recht auf Hochschulbildung - und die Art und Weise seiner Umsetzung nachzudenken .       
INFO: TARGET: Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , now that we have this report - for which I should like to thank Mrs de Sarnez - the time is right for the European Union to reflect on what it means by the right to education , and more specifically higher education , and how it intends to implement this right . 
INFO: SAMPLE: Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this report - on which I thank Mrs de @-@ Berès , has stood at the time for a Europe Charter of Culture , taking balanced staff and the right to be regulated correctly . 
INFO: SOURCE: ich habe den Eindruck , dass wir teilweise unter dem Vorwand des überaus berechtigten Schutzes von Kleinst@@ - und Klein@@ betrieben letztendlich eine Situation wiederfinden , auf die wir bei landwirtschaftlichen Themen sehr oft stoßen , nämlich , dass die Kleinen vorgeschoben werden , damit die Großen weiterhin ihre Situation absichern können .           
INFO: TARGET: I get the impression that , with the avo@@ wed intention of thoroughly justifiably protecting small businesses - some of which are very small indeed - we will end up back with a situation we very often encounter on agricultural issues , where the small players are used as a pretext while the big players can continue to safeguard their position . 
INFO: SAMPLE: I have the impression that is partly eligible for some of the most appropriate protection of specialist and small ones , where rates are very often achieved here on agriculture , for dispos@@ ing to other forms of total state force to counter their situation more . 
INFO: SOURCE: wie ich von meinen Kontakten zur Ölindustrie in Schottland weiß , hätte es Ein@@ wendungen dagegen gegeben , industri@@ ell produzierten Eth@@ yl@@ alkohol der Regelung für landwirtschaftlichen Organisationen zu unterwerfen , die ja ohne Kenntnis der Umstände in dem anderen Sektor eingerichtet worden sind , deshalb müssen wir hier von zwei Seiten vorgehen .         
INFO: TARGET: it would have been objectionable - I know from contacts of my own with the oil industry in Scotland - to sp@@ at@@ ch@@ co@@ ck the oil industry @-@ produced ethanol into an agricultural organisation which had been set up without regard to circumstances in the other sector , so we need a two @-@ handed approach to this .  
INFO: SAMPLE: speaking involving my contacts with oil the Pentagon in Scotland , Immigration broadcast pac@@ kets banning Member States that have been provided with their cases of regions and these things should therefore be earmarked in the other sector . 
INFO: SOURCE: meiner Meinung nach hängen die Ungleichgewichte bei der Bevölkerungs@@ verteilung und das demographische System unmittelbar mit den Diskrepanzen in Bezug auf die Entwicklung und Verteilung der Mittel auf der Erde , mit der sozialen Gerechtigkeit , der Ausbildung , der Gleichstellung der Geschlechter , den Menschenrechten und den Entwicklungs@@ modellen zusammen .            
INFO: TARGET: my own view is that there is a direct correlation between the uneven distribution of people on the planet and the demographic problem on the one hand and the development and distribution of the planet &apos;s resources and the question of social justice , education , equality of the sexes , human rights and development standards , on the other .  
INFO: SAMPLE: in my view , mutual conditionality to the population system and the demographic system will lead to disparities in economic conditions and distribution of funds on the planet , on social justice , training , education and equality between human rights , equality . 
INFO: SOURCE: nach den durch die Mitgliedstaaten vorgelegten Angaben sind offenkundig die meisten der Internetseiten , die politischen Extremismus oder sexuelle Gewalt ver@@ herr@@ lichen , sowie zahlreiche päd@@ ophi@@ le oder porno@@ gra@@ fische Seiten außerhalb der Europäischen Union angesiedelt , und deshalb ist in diesem Bereich nicht nur eine europäische , sondern eine weltweite Strategie erforderlich .       
INFO: TARGET: according to the information provided by the Member States , it seems that the majority of Internet sites advocating political extremism or which depi@@ ct sexual violence , and very many paedophile or pornographic sites are located outside the European Union , hence the importance of a strategy in this field that is not only European , but global .   
INFO: SAMPLE: according to the information provided by the Member States , the replacement of what is presented , with recre@@ ating cultural extremism or sexual violence becoming dead and lost @-@ identical centres outside the European Union , and , in this field , is not just a European policy for the world economy rather than a global common matter . 
INFO: SOURCE: dies kann einerseits dadurch erfolgen , dass der Medien@@ kunde in den Schulen , bei der die Jugendlichen lernen , schädliche Inhalte selbst zu erkennen , umfassende Aufmerksamkeit gewidmet wird , und andererseits , indem den Erziehungs@@ berechtigten eine Hilfe wie das niederländische Klassifizierungs@@ system &apos; ki@@ j@@ k@@ wi@@ j@@ zer &apos; an die Hand gegeben wird .     
INFO: TARGET: this is possible by , on the one hand , paying ample attention to media education at school , so that minors can be taught to identify harmful content for themselves , and , on the other hand , by providing edu@@ c@@ ators with a tool , such as the Dutch &apos; vie@@ wer guide &apos; classification system .   
INFO: SAMPLE: this could respond to the players &apos; concerns in schools to those young people who will be following directly being given to young people , amongst urbanisation , reacting alongside their students , such as the Dutch contributors , to grant the set of arbitrary patent network . 
INFO: SOURCE: umso bedauerlicher ist es , dass der Vorschlag der Kommission , die betriebliche Altersvorsorge als Teil des Aktionsplans für Finanzdienstleistungen europaweit im Binnenmarkt zu stärken , bis zur Stunde noch immer keine offizielle Antwort des Rates erhalten hat , sodass wir zur Stunde nicht verhandeln können .                 
INFO: TARGET: it is , then , all the more regrettable that the Commission proposal for Europe @-@ wide enhancement of occupational retirement provision in the Internal Market as part of the Financial Services Action Plan has to this moment still eli@@ cited no official response from the Council , so that we are at the moment unable to negotiate .    
INFO: SAMPLE: I am probably the utmost unfortunate because the Commission proposal to step up integrated pension pension measures as a subject of an social regulator &apos; programmes now inspire in the internal market to which there are still no compromise back or so plenary right to sign , so that we can never happen to negotiate seven times .

INFO: SAMPLE: nevertheless , as the rapporteur points out , in all cases there is too many resources clearly , not just aimed at survival of a model - Article 6 ( Article 10 ) - Article 25 ( 1998 ) ) but also of the economic interest of the interests of general interest ( Article 16 ) , for SMEs .

INFO: SOURCE: ich möchte vier davon hervorheben : die übermäßige Kompliziertheit der Rechtsvorschriften , das schwerfällige Proje@@ k@@ tz@@ y@@ kl@@ us@@ management , die unzureichende Abstimmung zwischen der Kommission und den Mitgliedstaaten bei der Umsetzung und der Kontrolle und schließlich die Schwerfälligkeit und die Folgen einer häufig zu klein@@ lichen Kontrolle , die das Verantwortungsgefühl unterminiert . 
INFO: TARGET: I shall give four examples . the first is the overly complex regulations , the difficulties in managing the project cycle , the poor interaction in execution and control between the Commission and the Member States , and , lastly , the often perni@@ ck@@ ety control which has the effect of taking away responsibility . 
INFO: SAMPLE: I would like to emphasise that , by writing , the difference in practice - and lastly its elementary set board processes of universal carrot across the Commission and Member States in approach and controls and lastly , is often surviving by the fringes and capacity that undermines the defects of responsibility . 
INFO: SOURCE: der Kommission wird ständig gesagt , dass Stress und Risiken für die Tiere beim Transport in erster Linie aus drei Faktoren resultieren : Fahr@@ zeit , Be- und Ent@@ laden der Tiere und die Bedingungen , unter denen sie transportiert werden - Bel@@ ü@@ ftung , Luft@@ feu@@ chte , Lade@@ dichte und so weiter . 
INFO: TARGET: the consistent advice to the Commission is that the stress and risk to animals in transport arises primarily from three factors : travelling time , loading and unloading of animals and the conditions in which they are transported - venti@@ lation , humi@@ dity , density and so on .       
INFO: SAMPLE: the Commission will catch on on no@@ isi@@ @-@ bog@@ mes that improvements come mainly in 178 at road transport properties to fishing , and to go further light and control over them , in other words , both those factors , road time and for@@ gery @-@ time , fa@@ red on the animals of the animals in shock : for one while using and continuing in the short @-@ term .

INFO: TARGET: we must remember that this report is the first report which assesses the first full year of the Prodi Commission - a Commission which , let us remind ourselves , was appointed with the specific remit of radical overhaul and reform of the European Union .           
INFO: SAMPLE: however , we must not forget that it is the first report under discussion that proved full , all the ready @-@ by @-@ Office for the Prodi Commission justification , overcoming a Commission - which - let us remember - will lodge a preference for haste and reform the European Union itself . 
INFO: SOURCE: daraus lässt sich schließen , dass jeder Vorschlag zur absoluten Begrenzung der Fahr@@ zeit in Wahrheit ausschließlich durch die Absicht anderer Länder begründet ist , Italien erhebliche Schlacht@@ quoten zu ent@@ reißen und bei der Rindfleisch@@ belie@@ ferung des italienischen Marktes den Platz unserer Erzeuger einzunehmen .          
INFO: TARGET: it can be seen from this that the sole motive behind any proposal to place an absolute limit on travelling time is actually other countries &apos; desire to strip Italy of a substantial part of its slaughter trade and to take the place of our producers in supplying beef and veal to the Italian market . 
INFO: SAMPLE: for example , each proposal to impose absolute tax for the absolute limitation of v@@ ings in truth exclusively from the objective of the other countries is to ent@@ u@@ sel @-@ throat exports to wretched animals which carry out the same transports as the animal and for wine @-@ friendly children of the Italian market .

INFO: TARGET: Commissioner , once more in this Parliament we are giving in to the temptation to tell the Commission exactly what it should be presenting us with , in great detail , in the next proposals for a directive they submit to us , to the extent that we are practically doing their job for them . 
INFO: SAMPLE: once again , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we in this Parliament expect the Commission to clarify the implementing proposals for Committee on a directive , and it is in the same detail that we have found the whole possible way to it exactly . 
INFO: SOURCE: richtig ist natürlich auch - und da stimme ich wahrscheinlich einigen Kommentaren hier im Parlament zu - , dass man unterscheiden muss , ob man das Geld nicht braucht , um das Ziel zu erfüllen , oder ob das Geld nicht implementiert werden konnte , weil es Haushalts@@ voll@@ zugs@@ defizite , Verwaltungs@@ defizite gibt . 
INFO: TARGET: I am probably agreeing with certain comments made in this Parliament when I say that the distinction has to be drawn between the money not being needed in order to achieve a given objective , and the money not having been able to be used because of faulty budget management or shortcomings in administration .  
INFO: SAMPLE: of course , it is also right - and it is , I am probably unanimous and , in agreement with this Parliament in the hope that monitoring should be viewed as a result if you do not take into account not we are doing our purpose , or whether money returns in the bill , for because there are budgetary requirements , problems in the spec@@ cks of household stagnation , as if we were to establish a position where .

INFO: SAMPLE: I would therefore ask the House to agree to the request that you presented , as proposed by the Council , to find this forward of the fisheries Council with its opinion on the way at which they were to be discussed by the point on which we planned a reopen on 27 of this month .

INFO: TARGET: the Commission announced its contribution to this fund in July ; it told us about it some months ago and it announced it publicly in Genoa more than three months ago ; and now it wants Parliament to express its opinion on this important issue in just one week .       
INFO: SAMPLE: indeed the Commission has sent good credit to this Fund in July ; we did all the Commission , who were heard some months ago , with opportunities present throughout the Genoa period in place only a couple of months and now best wants it that , at almost a week &apos;s approach , Parliament was on these important changes . 
INFO: SOURCE: wir glauben , dass in diesem Fall eine Rechtsgrundlage erforderlich ist und dass in jedem Fall aus Haushalts@@ sicht problemlos eine Änderung dieser Grundlage vorgenommen werden könnte , falls dies im Ergebnis der Verhandlung mit dem Rat am 21. dieses Monats erforderlich würde .             
INFO: TARGET: we believe that , in this case , a legal basis is necessary and , in any event , from the budgetary point of view , if it is necessary to amend that basis as a result of the negotiation with the Council on the 21 November , it could be done without any problem . 
INFO: SAMPLE: we believe that there is a need for a legal base in that particular form that , whenever this instrument paves the way of budgetary scrutiny , changes to this base could be made so though this would be an appropriate form of needing to change this proposal we will be seeing in the conciliatory conference . 
INFO: SOURCE: dies könnte nämlich dazu führen , dass die Geldwä@@ sche@@ untersuchungen in Wahrheit Untersuchungen sind , bei denen die Ermittlungs@@ behörden Sonder@@ voll@@ machten erhalten , um sozusagen vom Standard , d. h. von den normalen Verteidigungs@@ rechten abzuweichen , wie sie für die Informationen in Verfahren zu anderen Bereichen gelten .     
INFO: TARGET: this point introduces the danger that , in actual fact , the investigating authorities might use investigations into money laundering to obtain special powers as a way to get round the rules , so to speak , a way to get round the normal protection rights governing information obtained during proceedings on other issues .  
INFO: SAMPLE: this , without further incidents , is not being investigated correctly when separating taxpayers , where appropriate investigation citizens have been involved in discussing the particular documentation in which it is receiving the limits of any , of the standard of defence , which is in order to achieve the information provided in procedures for others as regards them .

INFO: SOURCE: allerdings ist zu befürchten , dass das von der Kommission und im Bericht Schleicher vorgeschlagene System der Finanzierung supranationaler europäischer Parteien einen bevorzugten Kanal der Korruption und insbesondere der Geldwäsche darstellen wird , sobald unbegrenzt Zuwendungen von juristischen Personen möglich sind und Zuwendungen von natürlichen Personen in einem Rahmen angenommen werden , der besonders nachlässig gehandhabt wird .

INFO: SOURCE: und da wir kurz vor Beginn der Fußball @-@ Weltmeisterschaft stehen , könnten wir sagen , dass es mit Ihrem Vorschlag , Herr Kommissar , in dem Spiel zwischen Nord und Süd derzeit 1 : 0 für Nord steht , aber dass das Spiel gerade erst begonnen hat , und wir hoffen , dass Sie sich als gerechter und ausgewogener Schiedsrichter beweisen werden . 
INFO: TARGET: and since the World Cup is about to start , we could say that the score according to your proposal , Mr Commissioner , is &apos; the North 1 - the South 0 &apos; , but we are at the beginning of the match and we hope that you will be a fair and un@@ biased ref@@ ere@@ e .

INFO: SOURCE: die erste Kritik , die ich am Vorschlag der Kommission ü@@ be , bezieht sich darauf , dass er die Vielfalt der Zusammensetzung der Fischereiflotte in der Europäischen Union unberücksichtigt lässt . in einigen Ländern besteht die Flotte größtenteils aus großen Schiffen , die in der industriellen Fischerei eingesetzt werden , in anderen Ländern setzt sich die Flotte überwiegend aus kleinen Schiffen zusammen . 
INFO: TARGET: the first criticism I have of the Commission proposal is that it does not take account of the diverse make @-@ up of the European Union &apos;s fishing fleet : some countries &apos; fleets consist mainly of large vessels used for industrial fishing and other countries which have predominantly small vessels .            
INFO: SAMPLE: the initial criticism that I am against the Commission proposal deals with though it does not leave the series of administration of the division of the dé@@ ten@@ te of the European fishing fleet ; in some countries , resources are being practised on large @-@ scale ships , where industrial fishing is found in industrial fishing , in other countries fleets that are as much as small ships han@@ ged . 
INFO: SOURCE: Nein , Sie haben einen Vorschlag auf den Weg gebracht , von dem ich denke , der ist in vielen Dingen wirklich zu begrüßen : mehr Marken@@ ver@@ trieb beispielsweise , die Aufhebung der zwan@@ g@@ haften Zusammenführung von Vertrieb und Wartung , also die Möglichkeit zur Trennung der beiden , die Stärkung unabhängiger Werkstätten , unabhängiger Ersatzteil@@ hersteller und anderes mehr .  
INFO: TARGET: no , you have submitted a proposal which , to my mind , really does have a great deal to commend it : multiple brand sales , for example , the abolition of the compulsory linking of sales and servicing , which can now be unbund@@ led , more independent workshops , independent spare part manufacturers and much more besides .   
INFO: SAMPLE: there is no call , in many areas of this , which I think is certainly very much to be welcomed : more energy , for example , the seeds of railway coordination and incitement and maintenance , it can be coupled with chance to split the two workers , the strengthening of sal@@ us@@ al manufacturers , cheap negative ingredients . 
INFO: SOURCE: ich finde es besonders gut , dass wir zu Beginn der gemeinsamen Entschließungen die gemeinsamen Werte zwischen Europa und Lateinamerika betonen , denn es ist wichtig , dass wir diese Partnerschaft nicht nur ökonomisch betrachten , sondern dass wir auch politisch über die gemeinsamen Werte sprechen und über die Dinge , die daraus folgen .          
INFO: TARGET: I see it as a particularly good thing that , at the start of the joint resolutions , we are emphasising the values which Europe and Latin America share , as it is important that we see this partnership not only in an economic light , but that we can also speak of our common values and their consequences in political terms . 
INFO: SAMPLE: I think it is particularly good that the launch of our common resolutions be this about the common values that we must make between Europe and Latin America . they are important in terms of abandoning this partnership in line and not merely economic mapping . we also wish to talk of the common values , and what are of course bearing in mind . 
INFO: SOURCE: die Kommission berücksichtigt die gut gemeinten Belange der Umwelt@@ gruppen , stellt sie aber über die der Fischerei und opfert schamlos grundlegende Prinzipien der Europäischen Union , wie den wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Zusammenhalt in den in hohem Maße von der Fischerei abhängigen Gebieten , die alle Ziel @-@ 1 @-@ Gebiete sind .            
INFO: TARGET: the Commission does take account of the well @-@ intentioned concerns of environment@@ alist groups , but puts them before those of the fishing world itself and sha@@ mel@@ essly sacrifices basic principles of the European Union , such as economic and social cohesion , in regions that are heavily dependent on fishing , all of which are Objective 1 regions .

INFO: TARGET: this new move follows on from the step taken at the Helsinki European Council last December , when it was decided that Malta had made sufficient progress to warrant opening bilateral conferences in February 2000 , i.e. by the end of this month , in order to commence negotiations on the conditions of accession to the Union and the adjustments required . 
INFO: SAMPLE: this would take the decision at the Helsinki European Council in December , following the progress made by Malta to getting round and add discord at the forthcoming IGC and then later this month - to enter into negotiations on conditions regarding the conditions of accession to Europe and of the need for adjustments which need to be moved into .

INFO: TARGET: this is a task that has lasted three years , and on which we have been consulted , so to speak , as a matter of course , when this issue , as has already been stressed , comprises highly important formal and substantive facets , which called for a range of assessments , consultations , concerted actions and co@@ decisions . 
INFO: SAMPLE: it coinci@@ ably that work has been done by three years on which we have , as it pleases , been consulted , as has been stressed - just a few particularly very important formal and material legal aspects , which has drawn into consideration by another type , therefore , denomin@@ atory means of scrutiny , consultation , conciliation and codecision .

INFO: SAMPLE: however , despite the many shortcomings of the text , the regulations in question are produced , but on issues of conditionality , it seems necessary to have a change to facilitate visiting the law &apos;s rights and the acceptance of individuals .

INFO: TARGET: I would nevertheless like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his work . he listened very closely to our arguments at the committee stage , and particularly those on the issue of respecting the rights of the defence , both at national level and at the level of cooperation on criminal law as part of European mutual assistance .  
INFO: SAMPLE: I would nonetheless like to thank the rapporteur and because he occupies his work , in which she has listened very carefully in what we have explained in depth by any views that the committee has given to us on the basis of the issue on safeguarding the rights of defence and the rights of mutual , integrated criminal judicial and judicial control . 
INFO: SOURCE: Herr Präsident , ich bin weder Mitglied des Ausschusses für die Freiheiten und Rechte der Bürger , Justiz und innere Angelegenheiten noch Jurist , aber ich kann wie fast alle Kollegen nachvollziehen , wie notwendig es ist , daß es neben dem einheitlichen Wirtschaftsraum in Europa auch einen entsprechenden einheitlichen Raum des Rechts , der Freiheit und der Sicherheit gibt . 
INFO: TARGET: Mr President , I am neither a member of the Legal Affairs Committee nor a lawyer , but like almost all of us , I understand the need for this Single Economic Area of Europe to have its parallel in a single area of freedom , security and justice .             
INFO: SAMPLE: Mr President , I have no member of the Legal Affairs Committee which we have a number of lawyer , as many as I can understand almost all the time available for us to view the need for society and the European Union to offer both the right to the Internal Economic and Security Area even outside that single economic area of justice , freedom and security .

INFO: SAMPLE: the only reason for Amendment No 7 for the report or Amendment No 5 on back to the Cunha report is that it will , at least , provide the right to set up certain financial prob@@ tions in terms of financial compensation , but the question remains unanswered of whether these wood means a great deal of compensation for compensating the loss of such natural values .

INFO: SAMPLE: Mr President , Madam President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioners , the WTO meeting in Qatar was a fashionable momentous one , particularly in the light of all those who : that globalisation is an extremely planet , ever most important of all concerned , for the task of deciding on globalisation as a democratic method for democratic attention . 
INFO: SOURCE: es ist richtig , dass eine strikte Begrenzung auf die vier in Nizza genannten Schwerpunkte die Glaubwürdigkeit des Konvents schwächen würde , das heißt , der Fragen@@ katalog muss erweitert werden , um den Erwartungen der Bürgerinnen und Bürger zu entsprechen und um die erweiterte Union zukunfts@@ fähig zu machen .           
INFO: TARGET: it is true to say that limiting ourselves strictly to the four priorities identified in Nice would weaken the credibility of the Convention , in other words the list of issues to be addressed needs to be widened in order to meet the public &apos;s expectations and to ensure that the enlarged Union will have a viable future .   
INFO: SAMPLE: it is true that even restricting the four priorities that will be developed in Nice would weaken the credibility of the Convention which aims to do beyond conventions which will have to be widened with appropriate conditions to meet the expectations of the citizens and to ensure that we have an impact on the binding European Union . 
INFO: SOURCE: das ist widersinnig , und deshalb ist unsere im Entschließungsentwurf enthaltene Forderung ganz einfach : wenn die Kommission , aus welchen Gründen auch immer , weiterhin in Euro zu laufenden Preisen arbeiten will , dann soll sie es tun , aber dann müssen auch die dem Parlament genannten Zahlen in Euro zu konstan@@ ten Preisen berechnet sein .    
INFO: TARGET: it makes no sense and therefore our request , included in the motion for a resolution , is very simple : if it suits the Commission to continue working , for whatever reason , in terms of current euros , it should do so , but the information it offers Parliament must also be expressed in standard euros .   
INFO: SAMPLE: that is absurd , and we therefore categorically object to the demand our motion for the motion for a report that sets out if the Commission , even if it did not want to continue to do so , still decides when they were in question at this time of circulation , but when we implement the Council &apos; s proposals in euros , things are also quite simply calculated .

INFO: TARGET: we will need , in fact , to make decisions with regard to further negotiations , notably with regard to investments and competition , issues that will have been studied during the first phase . it is obvious that this will be , for developing countries as well as for others , a very important time for assessment .

INFO: SAMPLE: the coordinators and the rapporteur will do everything we can to make sure that we harmonise qualified majority voting on Thursday ; we will also have to adopt this in if we cannot put up with the Council &apos; s views , not necessarily to assist the Commission reform in the course of us .
