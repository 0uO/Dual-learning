INFO: SAMPLE: at the same time , if we are to shorten the dogma of the free transport of all costs , to this effect the Commission has so faced the minimum possible worlds to Americans who wanted a embargo on &quot; British beef to have fallen , as did the Court of Justice sentenced to remove the principle of closing them up to the Court .
