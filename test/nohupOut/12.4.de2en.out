INFO: SOURCE: ebenso wie meine Vorredner bin ich der Meinung , daß die Berichte des Rechnungshofes der ganzen Sache eine neue Dringlichkeit verleihen . nebenbei sei erwähnt , daß wir Parlamentarier diese Entwicklung im Rahmen des Berichts von Professor Tsatsos , der bereits auf die dringende Notwendigkeit eines rechtlichen Status für die Parteien verwiesen hatte , voraus@@ gesehen haben . 
INFO: TARGET: I share the concern of other speakers that the reports of the Court of Auditors - which , by the way , we fully anticipated in this House several years ago with the report of Professor Tsatsos , which pointed out the urgent necessity of vali@@ dating parties in statutory terms - adds a new urgency . 
INFO: SAMPLE: as that is a person concerned , I understand that the reports of the Court of Auditors sent a cross @-@ reform that one which was far from closer to us , within the masses of Professor Giscard d , who said , now , of a full need for absolute legitimacy for the parties . 
INFO: SOURCE: übrig geblieben ist der Artikel 5. Ich meine , daß wir im Rahmen dieser Regierungskonferenz Überlegungen anstellen sollten , ob der Artikel 5 nicht als Protokoll zum EU @-@ Vertrag genommen werden kann und ob man es nicht jedem Mitgliedstaat überlassen soll , in souveräner Entscheidung festzulegen , ob er diesem Protokoll zustimmt oder nicht .   
INFO: TARGET: all that remains is Article 5 . I think this Intergovernmental Conference should consider whether Article 5 can be adopted in the form of a protocol to the EU Treaty and whether we should leave it to each Member State to take a sovereign decision as to whether or not it subscri@@ bes to this protocol . 
INFO: SAMPLE: I notice it is not acceptable , Article 5 , just as regards the agreement on this Intergovernmental Conference in order to confirm if Article 5 does not fall with words on EU Treaty awaiting the EU &apos;s serving or behaved in order if - without adopting any Member State , whether he put into this list . 
INFO: SOURCE: es ist sicher eine gute Absicht , sich auch für die Gesundheit von Rau@@ chern in Drittländern verantwortlich fühlen zu wollen . wenn dieses S@@ end@@ ungs@@ bewußtsein aber dazu führt , daß die Tabakindustrie ihre für den Export in Drittländer bestimmte Produktion dahin verlegt , haben wir lediglich den Abbau von Arbeitsplätzen erreicht .    
INFO: TARGET: wanting to accept a sense of responsibility for the health of smokers in third countries is obviously well meant , but when this sense of mission@@ ary purpose results in the tobacco industry relocating production intended for export to third countries outside the EU , then all we will have managed to achieve are job losses . 
INFO: SAMPLE: it is certainly a good thing that the poor consumer involvement is , indeed , obliged to feel the benefits of casualties in third countries , but that the dairy market acquired agents for inland reasons for which products for total food , an marked improvement in employment which stops fossil exports from that country . 
INFO: SOURCE: wenn schließlich auch eben wieder argumentiert wird , der Kosovo @-@ Krieg habe gezeigt , daß die EU eine größere militärische Unabhängigkeit von den USA benö@@ tige , so ist meiner Meinung nach dazu festzustellen , daß eine Militarisierung der internationalen Beziehungen und des sicherheitspolitischen Denkens die Abhängigkeit von den USA nicht verringern sondern verstärken wird .  
INFO: TARGET: finally , when it is again argued that the war in Kosovo demonstrated that the EU needs major military independence from the USA then , to my mind , this begs the conclusion that milit@@ arising international relations and security policy will increase , not reduce dependency on the USA .       
INFO: SAMPLE: finally , if you assess the justification that the EU can tell Europe , the EU is essential to strengthening the full residence of the United States and , in my view , the fact that you will generate more , whether the Eritrea retain any decisive means of respecting international relations and security key liability policy . 
INFO: SOURCE: zum anderen bleibe ich überzeugt , daß der Krieg gegen Jugoslawien mit konsequenter , präven@@ tiver und langfristiger Politik hätte vermieden werden können und müssen , zumal es sich in diesen Tagen erneut und dramatisch zeigt , daß sein angeb@@ liches oder tatsäch@@ liches Ziel , die Menschen- und Minderheitenrechte zu gewährleisten , katastrophal verfehlt wurde .  
INFO: TARGET: secondly , I am convinced that the war against Yugoslavia could and should have been avoided with a consistent , preventive , long @-@ term policy , especially as events over the last few days have again shown dramatically that its alleged or actual aim of safeguarding human and minority rights failed disast@@ ro@@ us@@ ly . 
INFO: SAMPLE: on behalf of what it is also sad to make before Moldova is effectively abolished , which may have transplan@@ ted a more coordinated and long way up for the offence of Yugoslavia , indicating that this is a huge challenge which has led to an equally unduly @-@ hand and competitive objective which is elu@@ gade confidence which has been very heavy . 
INFO: SOURCE: wir waren vor einigen Tagen bei der NATO @-@ Versammlung , und der Präsident der Nord@@ atlantischen Versammlung hat dort gesagt : &quot; die Weste@@ uropäische Union geht in der Europäischen Union auf . die EU hat ein Parlament .                   
INFO: TARGET: we attended the NATO assembly a few days ago , where the president of the North Atlantic assembly stated that the Western European Union was merging into the European Union , that the EU had a parliament , that NATO had a parliament and that the WEU assembly therefore had no further raison d &apos; être . 
INFO: SAMPLE: we were , a few days before Helsinki , the President of the northern People &apos; s Party hold - and he has said that the western European Union is going to discuss and that the EU has a Parliament launched .

INFO: TARGET: Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , now that we have this report - for which I should like to thank Mrs de Sarnez - the time is right for the European Union to reflect on what it means by the right to education , and more specifically higher education , and how it intends to implement this right .

INFO: SOURCE: ich habe den Eindruck , dass wir teilweise unter dem Vorwand des überaus berechtigten Schutzes von Kleinst@@ - und Klein@@ betrieben letztendlich eine Situation wiederfinden , auf die wir bei landwirtschaftlichen Themen sehr oft stoßen , nämlich , dass die Kleinen vorgeschoben werden , damit die Großen weiterhin ihre Situation absichern können .           
INFO: TARGET: I get the impression that , with the avo@@ wed intention of thoroughly justifiably protecting small businesses - some of which are very small indeed - we will end up back with a situation we very often encounter on agricultural issues , where the small players are used as a pretext while the big players can continue to safeguard their position . 
INFO: SAMPLE: I tried , Mr President , that the time I mentioned a debate on taking over in an continually represented in the way when pig and medium @-@ sized enterprises , we have not finally , a danger of concern , are particularly uns@@ ped , based on intensive businesses .

INFO: TARGET: it would have been objectionable - I know from contacts of my own with the oil industry in Scotland - to sp@@ at@@ ch@@ co@@ ck the oil industry @-@ produced ethanol into an agricultural organisation which had been set up without regard to circumstances in the other sector , so we need a two @-@ handed approach to this .  
INFO: SAMPLE: like me , as regards my contacts with the oil industry , the sk@@ pollution of certain crops was used to suspend nuclear education by the non @-@ third country , which was not represented without accept the circumstances within the latter sector , which will we be using two parties here .

INFO: TARGET: my own view is that there is a direct correlation between the uneven distribution of people on the planet and the demographic problem on the one hand and the development and distribution of the planet &apos;s resources and the question of social justice , education , equality of the sexes , human rights and development standards , on the other .  
INFO: SAMPLE: for example , takeover expectancy is running as well as the serious extent to which environmental protection and the distribution of this resources are affecting benefits . for social justice , training and training policies and drug @-@ living treatment . 
INFO: SOURCE: nach den durch die Mitgliedstaaten vorgelegten Angaben sind offenkundig die meisten der Internetseiten , die politischen Extremismus oder sexuelle Gewalt ver@@ herr@@ lichen , sowie zahlreiche päd@@ ophi@@ le oder porno@@ gra@@ fische Seiten außerhalb der Europäischen Union angesiedelt , und deshalb ist in diesem Bereich nicht nur eine europäische , sondern eine weltweite Strategie erforderlich .       
INFO: TARGET: according to the information provided by the Member States , it seems that the majority of Internet sites advocating political extremism or which depi@@ ct sexual violence , and very many paedophile or pornographic sites are located outside the European Union , hence the importance of a strategy in this field that is not only European , but global .   
INFO: SAMPLE: the information that has brought from the Member States clearly publicly states , which is sincere , policies or sexual violence which will undermine public marriage and atypical school @-@ hun@@ ed ethnic zones or the beaches or colonialism outside the European institutions , not only a European way in this area , but the international strategy which needs to be taken in this area .
